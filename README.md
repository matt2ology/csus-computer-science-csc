## Disclaimer 

This repo is for my own self-reference and to help others by learning from my success (and mistakes) so to help improve their own knowledge and skills.

To all those visiting expecting that all answers, solutions, and/or workouts to be accurate and correct (they often aren't) know that all work in this repo is a result of my own struggle, challenges, and failures to get the best grade as I can in the courses listed; so, don't cheat yourself of your own hard work and effort to learn the materials in the repo and achive better than I did.

Professors are aware of my repo and have anti-cheat software to detect similarities in code or solution.
