### Roomate Finder

#### Problem Statment

People need a way to find roomates in a certain location and price range

#### User Story

#### Users and stakeholders

| Users                       | Steakholders     |
| --------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Potential roomates (renter) | Real estate      |
|                             | College students |
|                             | Homeowners       |
| homeowner                   | Young adults     |

##### Actions

1. Create profile (all users) 2x
   1. One for house
   2. House to rent
2. Search for house ‚Üí roommate
   1. Search for rentee

#### Assumptions

1. Assume users enters correct info: location, name, ect.
2. Assume there are "enough" users
3. Assume age
4. Assume homeowner
5. Assume they are following the End-user license agreement (EULA)
6. Assume user remembers username and password

#### 6 Create a list of TWO assumptions on scope, cost and schedule that will prevent you from doing things that are not needed and prevent you from following a risky path. Scope, cost and schedule form the traditional constraint triangle. (5+5 points)

| Scope                  | Cost                     | Schedule |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ | -------- |
| Uneven split of rentee | No user sign-up cost     |          |
|                        | Revenue generaged by ADs |          |
|                        | Boost! (for money)       |          |
| Assume Users           |                          |          |

#### 7 Come up with TWO simple techniques how you will adapt the new Agile triangle (Value, Quality and traditional constraints) instead of the scope, cost, traditional constraint triangle alone. Give ONE specific example each of what you will focus on for Value and Quality and also the traditional constraint triangle. Give ONE example for Value and ONE example for Quality. (5+5 points)

| Value                  | Quality                  | Constraints |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------- |
| Uneven split of rentee | No user sign-up cost     |             |
|                        | Revenue generaged by ADs |             |
|                        | Boost! (for money)       |             |
