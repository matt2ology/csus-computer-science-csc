## Jarod Castillo - Self-Organizing Teams: What and How

### Jarod Castillo - (A) QUESTIONS

#### 1. What is a Self-Organizing Team?

**Answer:** People that work together and collaborate without the need of an assigned leader; are able to build on each other and express their ideas while allocating work respectively to their skill sets.

#### 2. Why do Self-organizing teams still need managers?

**Answer:** Managers need to set up the environment that's efficient for the team. They need to be in an optimal setting in order to maximize delivery value and know the boundaries of it. These managers are not the same as project managers.

#### 3. Does Time-boxing force any group to become a team? (Time-Boxing is shoving individuals into a figurative box and making them work with just a challenge handed to them.)

**Answer:** Teams actually need a clear goal, otherwise there's no point in creating a team. People in these teams need time to gauge each other's strengths and weaknesses. Humans need to build trust first before they work together efficiently.

### Jarod Castillo - (B) SUMMARY

There is an important quote from this reading, "A group of motivated individuals...". This has to be assumed before any member of the team can self-assign work. The hard part is the prerequisite and filtering of individuals that are able to do this work. The paper covers some ideas of it in the sections of training, coaching, and mentoring, but where is the line drawn? The paper only covers how to get individuals working together, but finding the individuals who are willing to put the hours in and collaborate is a difficult task.

## Sharon Fitzpatrick - What is Design Thinking and Why Is It So Popular?

### Sharon Fitzpatrick - (A) QUESTIONS

#### 1. In your own words, what is Design Thinking?

**Answer:** Design Thinking is the iterative process in which designers try to understand and empathize with the individuals who will be using the product. It is the solution focused process of challenging assumptions,and constantly re-evaluating alternative solutions that better suit the users.

#### 2. Design thinking aims to have what type of understanding of the problem?

**Answer:** Design thinking must have a holistic and empathic understanding of the problem and how it impacts people. Design thinkers constantly re-evaluate the solutions they propose until they find a solution that best fits the people the solution is for.

#### 3. What are the phases of Design Thinking? Should they be done in order?

**Answer:**

1. Emphasize
2. Define
3. Ideate
4. Prototype
5. Test
6. No, they do not need to be done in order. Instead, they can be done in any order and repeated many times until the optimal solution is found.

### Sharon Fitzpatrick - (B) SUMMARY

From my own experience working with Design Thinking I find that it truly does get you into thee shoes of your users, but it is often difficult to implement in the workplace due to strict deadlines. In the article it says to implement Design Thinking at all levels in the workplace, however this is often not realistic as different departments have many different deadlines to meet and communication between different departments is often difficult. I feel that this article does not address how to effectively implement Design Thinking in the workplace, but it does showcase what they key ideas of Design Thinking are.

## Mohammed Msallam - The Beginners Guide to BDD

### Mohammed Msallam - (A) QUESTIONS

#### 1.What is Behavior Driven Development (BDD)?

**Answer:** Behavior driven development can help achieve the developers understanding of what needs to be built, and understanding of the technical challenges their requirements may present. And ultimately helps a business and its technical team deliver software that fulfils business goals.

#### 2.When is Behavior Driven Development (BDD) useful?

**Answer:** BDD useful to aid the management and the delivery of software development projects by improving communication between engineers and professionals. BDD ensures all development projects stay focused on delivering what the business actually needs and meeting all user requirements.

#### 3.What are the two main parts in BDD?

**Answer:** The first part is the practice of using examples written in ubiquitous language to illustrate behaviours. The second part is the practice of using those examples as the basis of automated tests. And also to check functionality for the user, to ensure the system works as defined by the business throughout the project lifetime.

### Mohammed Msallam - (B) SUMMARY

From the readings and the past experience I had where we had to build an app for caltrans I learned that identifying the desired behaviour of a given feature from the very beginning is very important because it is key to ensure the project will be successful and set the plan to meet the client requirements. Also the regular meetings we had to do to show our progress with the client and do prototypes to seek their opinion so communication is a big factor for a successful project.

## Daisy Le - What Does it Mean to Have an Agile Mindset

### Daisy Le - (A) QUESTIONS

#### 1. Why is having an 'agile' mindset so important in team projects?

**Answer:** The definition of agile itself on dictionary.com means to be able to move quickly and easily. However, in projects, to have an agile mindset means to be able to 'maneuver', which in a way can be similar to the dictionary definition. It means to maneuver or be able to move or face through difficulties, thrive and learn from projects, and aim for the end goal of success for the team as efficiently as possible with the limited amount of time given. To have such a mindset itself is important in team projects because to have such an attitude for projects in a positive manner creates motivation and enthusiasm for the end goal. You're willing to learn even if it means from mistakes, win as a team, and have an open mindset to all ideas if it means reaching the end results to create a quality product.

#### 2. What is pragmatism?

**Answer:** Pragmatism- also an important part of the agile mindset, is the way of choosing more practical options than those that only suits your needs. When working on a project, you need to consider the work and options that would suit the project team best in terms of their abilities and capabilities. Just because the project will be absolutely perfect if it's done a certain way means it would be considerably the best choice. This could lead to more issues when needs become too specific. Therefore, allowing flexibility to the ideas creating the final project is far more advantageous. With that, the project will still prioritize quality but in a way that takes account for the skill levels of its team members.

#### 3. Why do you need to fail with an Agile Mindset?

**Answer:** No human being is born perfect. In fact, we learn from our mistakes. We are built on a foundation of learning from mistakes and in project management, it is no different. There are plenty of crucial errors that one can make but we will never definitely know for sure if they exist until one occurs. And when these do happen, we study and learn from these mistakes, making sure to take preventive actions in the future to stop them from happening again. Even if one mistake can be costly, it is better to make them early on, fixing them before it gets too big to handle. It is okay to make mistakes, learning from these mistakes is not a crime. In fact, not willing to learn from them is the crime instead. Acting stubborn, refusing to accept the part that a mistake has been done goes against the agile mindset. In the agile mindset, you must be willing to make mistakes and learn from them.

### Daisy Le - (B) SUMMARY

Understanding that humans all make mistakes is really important especially when going through team projects. You should learn to also depend on your team to have your back when things go wrong, not face difficulties and hardships on your own. With an agile mindset, you are not aiming to simply get things done, but rather learn as a team to achieve those goals. Because the relationships you develop as a team and the knowledge you obtain through the journey towards completing a project is what will last longer than simply getting things done. Even when you make mistakes, these errors are learned as lifetime lessons, keeping you in check to be less likely to make them happen again. The definition of success in the end is not how well you can take on every task on your own, but how well you can contribute as a team. This is what having an agile mindset means.

## Belle Nguyen - What can we learn from a lean car plant?

### Belle Nguyen - (A) QUESTIONS

#### 1. Why was it that “No Problem” is a problem?

**Answer:** In order to have a key learning experience, we need to have the ability to highlight problems and fix the cause without placing blame on others. When we place blame on an individual the problem tends to be passed on to others and thus when asked how things are going saying “ No problem” can be the problem. There are always problems that can be solved and cause improvement to the project.

#### 2. Was it collaboration or a clash of cultures in the workplace?

**Answer:** According to the article, it was a clash or culture since the GM culture rewarded seniority as the more time you worked with the group determines your career progression. However with the TPS Culture, everyone had to learn every job on the team and take turns doing them. Thus people started pointing fingers at each other when a problem arised. Small perks even added to this too and made the tension worse.

#### 3. What is a great reference to look at?

**Answer:** A great reference into introducing new ideas and help take a hold onto them is a book called Fearless Change in which deals with the subjects of organisation and change, where to start, how to continue convincing people and dealing with resistance amongst the people. However it doesn’t mention agile too much and mostly focuses on IT and this be wary.

### Belle Nguyen - (B) SUMMARY

From this article, we can definitely learn what happened to the lean car plant as the title says. By taking in new techniques, we can become more proficient and have a new perspective when facing problems. However, we can also take into caution that with new techniques they can clash with old ones that stand strong and so when problems arise, people may point fingers at each other and the problem will not get solved.

## Dominic Nance - Requirements Specifications on Agile Projects

### Dominic Nance - (A) QUESTIONS

#### 1. What are the best practices that AMDD includes?

**Answer:** Some of the best practices that the Agile Model Driven Development use is active stakeholder participation, prioritizing which assignments should be completed first, considering the amount of work before you start a work item, scoping the project, modeling each iteration, modeling each requirement, and test requirements.

#### 2. What are one of the reasons why agilists see documentation as the “worst strategy available to communicate information between people?”

**Answer:** One of those reasons is a theory referred to as media richness theory (MRT), which compares various modes of communication. Comparatively among numerous other forms of communication such as email, calls, and chat, documentation did the worst among the team and the stakeholders.

#### 3. What is the most effective working strategy that projects the best success rate?

**Answer:** According to research conducted by the author of the paper, iterative processes perform the best success rate with Agile following close behind; however, Agile methods have the best way of communicating stakeholder needs better than iterative.

## Dominic Nance - (B) SUMMARY

This paper discusses the spec that requirements hold on a project, while also discussing other topics such as the roles that business analysts play in an Agile framework. Business analysts go through a process of development referred to as AMDD where it ensures that many aspects of the project are covered. Among some of the topics of an Agile framework, documentation was questioned whether it was effective in communication and, according to MRT, documentation performs the least effective. Lastly, another takeaway was that, according to research conducted by the author, Agile is the most effective regarding its success rate and the effectiveness of meeting stakeholder needs.

## Yared Engida - What Is An AGILE Business Analyst?

### Yared Engida - (A) QUESTIONS

#### 1. What is an agile business analyst ?

**ANSWER:** An agile business analyst is generally applied to business analysts who work in an agile software development environment. Some claim that a business analyst is and really always has been agile. Flexibility, reactivity, originality, inventive thinking, acceptance of change, and a reliance on humans and interactions are all required skills in the field of business analysis.

#### 2. What are the characteristics of an agile business analyst ?

**ANSWER:** The main characteristics of an agile business analyst are communication expert, problem solving ability, critical thinking, analytical bend of mind, process modelling, and business orientation. Adding value to the organization, looking for new approaches to solve problems, having a leadership model through influence and communication, and being fully aware of the problem and being able to overcome it makes a good characteristics of an agile business analyst,

#### 3. Are agile business analysts "agile" ?

**ANSWER:** Agility in business analysis is an attitude that has nothing to do with the framework in which a business analyst works. Whether he works on a scrum team, another agile team, or no agile team, an agile business analyst is agile.

### Yared Engida - (B) SUMMARY

Having the term "agile'' applied to a business analyst doesn't change or differentiate the job task. I don't agree with the claim that the developers can do their own business analysis and an extra person in the position of business analyst simply gets in the way. An agile business analyst is generally applied to business analysts who work in an agile software development environment.
