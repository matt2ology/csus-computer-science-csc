Dear students,

This is a team memo assignment.

Please choose all **seven** papers from:

Files â†’ Readings

The team divides themselves into small groups and assigns each paper to each group. Perhaps the team has three small groups A, B, and C, each with two or three members. Please make sure each small group reads only a small portion a day (first divide into perhaps 6 small portions to cover maybe in 6 days) of their assigned paper and takes notes immediately as you read and when you like some idea or concept or technique or anything mark it.

**Summarize all the things you liked as a question and answer.**

The small group (let us say group A) after completing summarizing will explain their ideas to the entire team. The rest of the main team will now ask some questions to group A, for example:

for the "Beginner's guide to BDD" one of your questions may look like this:

When is Behavior Driven Development (BDD) useful?

or a surprise question for something that is not detailed in the paper just to stimulate or provoke thinking in group A.

Then group A provides an answer or attempts to go explore, find and provide an answer.

**Do this for a minimum of three questions. Group A answers the three questions, plus also provide a single collective opinion of their own on any concept which is different from or supplements the ideas not in the paper.**

It is a good practice for _every_ member of each small group to read the paper assigned to them. For example, all members of group A read the same paper separately and gather their individual ideas and share it with other members of their own group A first.

**For each paper, a single or half page memo is more than sufficient with:**

(a) at least three simple questions and three answers and

(b) two or three lines of your personal simple opinion on any aspect which is different from the paper or adds on to the paper.

As analysts, you will be required to take the lead in different unusual situations. You may have gained knowledge and may have been well prepared on some project initiatives at work. But, when many teams at work attend a discussion or planning meeting, you will find surprising perspectives you never knew or thought of. Being aware that a few unexpected questions or twists and turns, will arise in the meeting will make you a good analyst. This will enhance your speaking and individual presentation skills and your self-confidence. At DMV, we have quite a few business analysts since there are so many sub-topics and they are simply amazing and usually they take key crucial decisions and play an incredible, wonderful, important lead role in each project. :)

Best wishes and cheers,

:)
