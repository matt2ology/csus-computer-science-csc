    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Deliver value:</strong> That you or the team outputs satisfies the respective stakeholder's
                needs while making reasonable and proper decisions and measuring success in the project/product
                life cycle; all the while, paying attention to the triple constraints of cost, time, and scope.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Collaborate:</strong> Has two aspects - one the ability of the team members to work
                together as effectively as possible and two team members who are actually doing the
                core work of the project are the ones doing the planning and status reporting.
                As an illustration, the first aspect means that barriers prohibiting effective communication,
                for example jargon, are removed from the team environment and there are team members
                who can effectively facilitate the group interactions, and the second aspect team members
                should volunteer to work on various items, as opposed to getting assignments from someone else.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Iterate:</strong> An iterative approach is getting some actionable feedback on the output of the
                iteration so that you know if you are on the right course toward the desired outcome.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Simplify:</strong> To <code>simplify</code> is to maximize the amount of work not done; to
                emphasize, you want to deliver the minimum output that will maximize outcome and do it using only
                processes that are absolutely necessary.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Consider context:</strong> This articulates a team's situational awareness; in general, teams
                need to consider context when choosing which processes, practices, and techniques they use so they can
                be sure they are doing the things that will make them successful and are not doing the things that don’t
                need to be done.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Decide wisely:</strong> is to depend on well-informed, timely decisions.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Reflect and adapt:</strong> is to argue that your team should continuously learn from its

    <p><strong>Simplify:</strong> the product was too simple, basic, and other product the same if not
        better than what we offered. To avoid this pitfall we must <code>deliver value</code> to our customers.
        The complaint was that our product &quot;is too simple&quot; and that &quot;other products&quot;
        can do the same if not better; so, by leveraging our resources better (technology, staff, time)
        we can produce a better product and iterate on features that makes our product unique.</p>

        a <code>change</code> the act of transformation in response to a need; two the <code>need</code> is a problem
        or opportunity to be addressed; three a <code>solution</code>- a specific way of satisfying one

        a relationship to the change, the need, or the solution; five <code>value</code> is the worth,
        importance, or usefulness of something to a stakeholder within a context; and six the

        customers at their leisure, order food, pay, and have a independent contractor deliver
        the food from the restraint to the customer's location.</p>
    <p>4. <strong>Stakeholder:</strong> Are the restaurants, customer, delivery contractors, and DoorDash.</p>
    <p>5. <strong>Value:</strong> Having this solution/service restaurants are able to offer food delivery without much
        infrastructure overhead and need to excessively over staffing for potential fluctuating and irregular delivery
        request.</p>
    <p>6. <strong>Context:</strong> Not all restaurants can offer food delivery and now they can with the built
        platform.</p>

    <p>(Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have this time)</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Must have:</strong> The ability to create a profile to allow users to represent themselves
            and have their own criteria,so they can be matched with other desired homeowners/renters.
            Otherwise, there is no way for users to match based on the information in their profiles
            like location type and price range.</li>
        <li><strong>Should have:</strong> When a user is making a profile they <em>should have</em> a way to enter in
            their information.</li>
        <li><strong>Could have:</strong> A way to verify if users are real with a photo id</li>

        <li><strong>Negotiable:</strong> users must be able to capture the essential details about
            themselves like their price range, location,and type.</li>
        <li><strong>Value:</strong> Shows the user’s availability and needs to other users</li>
        <li><strong>Estimable:</strong> Can be estimated in the number of hours it takes to build the
            profile in html, css, and js.</li>
        <li><strong>Small:</strong> Building the profile is a small task that consists of displaying the
            user information and a button for submitting the user’s information.</li>
        <li><strong>Testable:</strong> To test this we would submit sample user information into the
            appropriate fields, click the submit button, and see if the sample user information we created displays.

    <p>(Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have this time)</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Must have:</strong> Search is necessary because users need to quickly network with
            other users who meet their search criteria. Otherwise matching homeowners and
            renters could not find each other.</li>
        <li><strong>Should have:</strong> The search results should show the closest matches to the
            search criteria first, with less close matches following in descending order.</li>
        <li><strong>Could have:</strong> It would be nice to be able to optimize searches with pre defined
            user tags such as location, price range, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Wouldn’t have:</strong> No results should be shown that are not relevant to the search criteria.

    <h5 id="search-invest">Search: INVEST</h5>
    <p>(Independent, Negotiable, Value, Estimable, Small, Testable)</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Independent:</strong> Users enter their search criteria and results depend on user type (homeowner
            or renter)</li>
        <li><strong>Negotiable:</strong> Users specify the search parameters and get desired results</li>
        <li><strong>Value:</strong> Makes it easier for users to find each other by filtering in only the users that
            meet the search criteria</li>
        <li><strong>Estimable:</strong> We as developers know how long it takes to make a dropdown menu for the search
            bar and the time it takes to develop a search algorithm like Binary Search.</li>
        <li><strong>Small:</strong> Drop down menu for search bar and binary search</li>

            <p><strong>Customer development:</strong> is helpful when we don’t know the problem.
                When the problem isn't know it's important that we develop a framework to discover:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><code>Validate</code> that we have identified the market for our product</li>
                <li><code>Build</code> the right product features that actually solve the customer's needs</li>
                <li><code>Tested</code> the correct methods for acquiring and converting customers</li>
                <li><code>Deployed</code> the right resources to scale business</li>
            </ol>
            <pre><code class="language-text"><div>For example: The advertising agency Goodby Silverstein &amp; Partners for the
California Milk Processor Board in 1993.

The dairy industry tried for 20 years to convince their customers that milk
was good for you and sales were falling (Validate); and then, they built a
marketing campaign about the lack of the product &quot;Got Milk?&quot; (build)
which weretested in probably in some board rooms and selected users (tested).
After testing were done they then made the decicion to fully launch (deploy)
with the marketing campaign.
</div></code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Build-Measure-Learn:</strong> The Build-Measure-Learn Loop is important for:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><code>Build</code> step makes you pick a specific solution to deliver (the output)</li>
                <li><code>Measure</code> step defines the output of the product</li>
                <li><code>Learn</code> step examine the data and decide if the change you delivered made
                    the impact you wanted. If not, try something else and start the whole cycle
                    all over using your remaining options</li>

This is important; for, it is a loop that allows for

In a quick example this is used in game development from the first
iterationof a game to the next installment. First a team develops
the story and game play (build), then have people play test the
game to obtain levels of engagement and enjoyment (measure), and
finally examine the collected data to decide if their original ideas
are inline with the desired impact else they have to course correct
and start the cycle over again using the remaining time, skill and

            <p><strong>Metrics:</strong> Enables one to gauge success. Having the right kind of metrics
                help you indicate whether he or she is achieving the desired outcome(s).
                Characteristics of Good Metrics are:</p>

        Question 15 (5 bonus points) Explain the process and conditions for &quot;Simplify&quot; Guiding Principle with
        two good examples</h2>
    <h3 id="define">Define</h3>
    <p>The process and conditions for &quot;Simplify&quot; Guiding Principle is to start with a
        barely sufficient approach, the absolutely essential abilities/features to the product/service,
        and with a small set of activates focuses allows oneself or one's team to maintain a streamlined process.</p>
    <h3 id="example">Example</h3>
    <h4 id="a-text-messaging-app">A text messaging app</h4>
    <p><strong>The essential ability/feature:</strong> Simply have the app send raw, unformatted, Ascii characters.</p>
    <p>This most straight forward approach ignores &quot;complex&quot; features like end-to-end encryption,
        formatted text, support for emojis, and sending attachments. Simply having the means of
        sending simple Ascii characters archives the minimum viable product goals and provides the
        fundamental foundation to what a text messaging app needs.</p>
    <h4 id="restaurant-app">restaurant App</h4>
    <p><strong>The essential ability/feature:</strong> A static website that features the restaurant's
        hours, menu, prices, location, and contact information.</p>
    <p>This ignores the arguably &quot;non-essential&quot; features that lengthens product development,
        increased resource allocation, and skill acquisition.  Although it is more leg work for
        the end user the minimum viable product still serves it's purpose and function.</p>
