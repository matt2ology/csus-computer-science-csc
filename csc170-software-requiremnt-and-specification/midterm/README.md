## Quiz Instructions

Dear students,

Please read each question carefully and pick or write the best answer suitable. Canvas automatically saves your answers before you exit each time and brings back your work when you return. Hit the submit button only when you have completed the mid-term and are ready to submit.

There is one slot (question) where you can upload a single document for all of your answers if you do not wish to enter your answers for each question directly in Canvas.

Pay close attention to the essay-like questions as you will need to write descriptive details rather than stating the obvious. There is only one answer for each multiple-choice and true/false question. The first set of questions is 5 essay-like, the second set is true/false, the third set is multiple choice, and the last set is short answers. Short answers don't mean 3-5 words, you will need more than that, think it like a shorter essay-like question. Work independently. Please take this exam seriously as you are in an interview for a software engineering or IT or agile Business Analyst position.

Best Wishes and Cheers,

:)
