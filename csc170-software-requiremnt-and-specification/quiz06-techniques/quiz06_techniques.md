## Instructions

Dear students,

The questions on this quiz are "what do you like about this technique?" kind of questions.
Please read chapters 11-15 in the text book. This quiz is what you will need to accomplish
your team class project so you have time until the due date to complete your readings.
Do your readings as a team collaboration effort and ensure all team members are on the same page on the concepts.

In your own words you may express what you like about each technique and answer the relevant questions.
Provide simple intuitive answers rather than quoting directly from the text book.

Please plan so that you do not take a total of more than 1 hour to 1 hour and 30 minutes to complete this quiz.
It is okay if your answers are not 100% correct. So aim not to spend more than 15 minutes per question.
These are "asking for your opinion" type of questions in this quiz.

Provide intuitive answers rather than quoting directly from the PowerPoint slides or the text book,
although the references are provided from the slides or the text book. When you are referencing the
text book or PowerPoint slides, directly jump to the item by searching with the keywords to get only
a cursory understanding and not necessarily a detailed understanding.

This process will help you get more awareness of some concepts. That is the objective.

Best wishes and cheers,

:)
