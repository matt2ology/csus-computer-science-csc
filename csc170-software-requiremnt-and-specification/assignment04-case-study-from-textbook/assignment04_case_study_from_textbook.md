## A. Describe the problem the case study is attempting to solve. 20%

Case study, from chapter ten, Student Information System attempts to solve enrollment and communication between parents, faculty, and staff. Technology is lagging behind, enrollment fees were handled through email, and the enrollment process is paper based. When paper information arrives at the school office, it has to be translated from paper to computer records. Solving this problem prevents enrollment discouragement, as families would be struggling with a multitude of steps to enroll their child.

### Introduction (& maybe also compare similarities b/w this case study and our project)

Finding the right person isn’t limited to romantic relationships. Our project makes finding a roommate more fun and rewarding by connecting people who may not have otherwise met in person. This platform allows anyone to find a roommate who are in-tune to each user’s individual persona, budget, diet, locations, ect. Similar to the case study in Chapter Ten, Student Information System, our project aims to streamline and ease the process of filling out forms/paperwork, handling rent payment, invoicing, and communication.

### The Need

The current issue is that, while the school attempts to keep their technology recent, the technology is rather primitive. This caused some methods of processing information, such as checks from parents and a lackluster enrolling process, to be very arbitrary. The school still used the method of writing on paper to receive student information rather than online documentation. In the meantime, the school started some ambitious expansion projects involving large investments to the school. As a result, the school didn’t consider the method of enrollment to be upgraded. In the process of choosing an enrollment process that’s timely and cost effective, the school board decided to find a solution to this issue that’ll improve the enrollment process and improve the communication of such to parents and faculty.

### The Possible Solution(s)

#### Solution 1

Since the school did not have an internal IT department they could turn to, the way they provided enrollment and communication capabilities was to purchase a system. Thus they searched for a Student Information System so that it gave students and parents access. The directory allows parents to search by grade so that they can update their information, make information private, or export a directory.

#### Solution 2

In effort to minimize enrollment discouragement, as families would be struggling with a multitude of steps to enroll their child and to keep the school technology recent, the school decided that the only viable way to provide enrollment and communication capabilities was to purchase a system. By creating a parent/classroom portal where teachers in each classroom have access to a parent portal where they can publish information and remarks on their classes. Having a forum format where parents and teachers can interact and communicate is a simple but effective way of solving the issue.

#### Solution 3

The school needed to improve the enrollment process, so they decided that the only way to improve the enrollment capabilities was to purchase a system which is Student information system(SIS). The system allows students to online enrollment, students to update their information and the system supports the acceptance of credit card and/or ACH transactions.

### Lessons Learned

With the problem that the school has faced, we have learned that the Purpose-Based Alignment Model is usable for nonprofits. With this model, it can tell us if a solution can handle enrollment and personalized lesson planning. We also learned that considering projects in a broader perspective for the entire organization is also something substantial and crucial with problem solving existing issues and improving the organization. Another lesson that was learned is to look out for possible solutions that would bring more problems, especially since not every project will create financial benefits. Finances are not infinite, therefore we cannot afford to test out every possible solution only to deficit funds and create more issues. Finally, requirements should not be written overly specific as it can limit your options that could possibly be a good solution.

### What is the best take away that will help you with your project?

The best takeaway from this case study is not to get too focused on narrowly defined solutions and to instead focus on understanding the need and its context. In this case study they were so focused on adapting a SaaS model for the enrollment system, they failed to fully understand the need and thus chose a solution that did not meet their needs. For our project we need to be careful to understand our user demographics needs and what they truly want out of our app instead of shiny features we see other popular apps using. I think that by taking the time and energy to see the world through the eyes of our user and evaluate the priority of their needs and how they would like the app to look and function we can avoid the problems faced in this case study.

### Is there any new idea you will be adding by discussing as a team, which goes beyond the case study?

For the new idea we can implement, while having a system in which allows communication and connection in our project, we need to keep in mind that we can’t only focus on that, and in order for that to work we need to match people together first to have communication. So we will be implementing a feature in which you swipe left to reject a potential “roommate” or swipe right to let the other person know that you are interested in them being a roommate. Sort of like a dating app mechanic but instead of looking for love, you are looking for the next roommate to have. That way, once we have our groups that are matched, we can implement the communication system that is very similar to the case study we read so they can see what the person is like as they communicate with them.
