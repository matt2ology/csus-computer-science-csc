## Introduction

Dear students,

Please work on one Case Study from the text book from Part II. Choose a case study which mostly resembles your team project.

Then summarize the case study by dividing the work among each of your team members. You plan as a team your divide-and-conquer strategy.

However, at the end, all team members must be on the same page and learn from each other.

1. Describe the problem the case study is attempting to solve. 20%

2. Make sure you summarize each section of your case study. 50%

3. Then answer these two simple questions creatively: 30%

   1. What is the best take away, that will help you with your project?
   2. Is there any new idea you will be adding by discussing as a team, which goes beyond the case study?

In your PDF, please list each team member's name against each item, who contributed to help the team succeed

best wishes,

Jagan
