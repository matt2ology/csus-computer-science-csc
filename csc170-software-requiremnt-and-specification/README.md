representing real-time requirements, and the use of Computer-Aided Software
Engineering (CASE) tools to illustrate analysis concepts.

## OBJECTIVE OF THE COURSE

Although the name of the class seems it is about requirements,
this class is much more than that, it is the study of the analysis that happens
prior to gathering requirements! Hence this is also a management and leadership
course and this course can very well help you get into a leadership role very
quickly since you will have to put yourself in the shoes of many roles such as
all stakeholders including the users, invested people, CIO, CEO and many other
roles in order to learn how to do a meaningful analysis that benefits your
