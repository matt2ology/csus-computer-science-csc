## Instructions

Dear students,

Please answer the following Quiz on Chapter1 Guiding Principles.
The PowerPoint slides should be sufficient to answer. The purpose of the quiz is
that by answering the quiz you are getting a chance to simultaneously consolidate
your understanding of the class material. You can start the quiz now and complete by due date.
Answers will not be viewable until later.

For the "match the following" question, first please play with different combinations
on a piece of paper or online. Some combinations will look correct. But, if you
try a different combination, it may be even better and closer match.

Some multiple choice questions may have more than one answer.

For fill-in-the-blanks, do your best. I will go through each fill-in-the-blank answer manually as well.

Best Wishes and Cheers,

:)

Jagan
