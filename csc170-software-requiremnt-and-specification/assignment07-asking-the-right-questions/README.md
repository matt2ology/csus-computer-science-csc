Dear students,

Please work in your teams on this assignment. Consider this too as a part of your
final project deliverable just like the "project concept" assignment.

This assignment will provide unique insights for a business analyst or a managerial person,
just by asking these questions. The assignment teaches to ask the right questions which is valuable.
The questions are generalizations of the questions on paper claims in the slides on "Helpful Concepts".
This assignment is similar to, but not exactly same as, the "Project Opportunity Assessment" Technique in Chapter 13 of the text book.

## The assignment

You plan to achieve a goal to solve a specific problem.

State a specific problem in the context of your class project and a specific goal
you set for your organization (or team) to address the problem.

Now for this goal ask yourself these questions:

1. Is it worth it to pursue addressing this problem?

2. Why do we think the problem exists in the first place?
(for example, if the problem will go away all by itself in a short time, say two months, then it is really not a problem)

3. Is this problem the biggest hurdle to achieve your primary organizational goals?
(for example, are there other organizational goals, the outcomes of which outweigh the
outcome of this specific goal or is this specific goal going to distract your organization
from an efficient path, with very little benefit?)

4. Is your organization losing somewhere else by switching your focus to this specific problem?
