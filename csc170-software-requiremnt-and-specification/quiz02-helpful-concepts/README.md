## Instructions

Dear students,

Please answer the following Quiz on Chapter 2 Helpful Concepts to refresh your mind and practice.
The PowerPoint slides should be sufficient to answer. The purpose of the quiz is that by answering
the quiz you are getting a chance to simultaneously consolidate your understanding of the class material.
You can start the quiz now and complete by due date. Answers will not be viewable until later.

For the "match the following" question, first please play with different combinations on a piece of paper or online.
Some combinations will look correct. But, if you try a different combination, it may be an even better and closer match.

For multiple choice and true or false, there is only one correct answer (letter).

For fill-in-the-blanks, do your best. I will go through each fill-in-the-blank answer manually as well.

This quiz will be out of 25 points, 1 point for each question (except fill-in-the-blanks 2 points per question).

Best Wishes and Cheers,

:)

Jagan
