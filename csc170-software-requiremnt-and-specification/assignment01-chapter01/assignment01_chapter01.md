## 1. Google and answer: What are the four key values of the Agile Manifesto?

1. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
2. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
3. Responding to change over following a plan
4. Working software over comprehensive documentation

## 2. Google and answer: What are the 12 key principles of the Agile Manifesto?

```text
Answer the following questions in ONLY one, two or three (and not more than three)
brief sentences by reading the first chapter of the Text book and going through the PowerPoint slides for the first chapter:
```

1. The highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late into development as agile harnesses change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity, which is the art of maximizing the amount of work not done, is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## 3. For Delivering Value, is Value easy to define? Why or why not?

Value is not easy to define because it varies depending on what projects and the person’s perspective. We are able to achieve value by creating outputs that makes strides towards the outcome we want.However, the desired outcome can since each person can have a different definition of values.

### (a) What is the agile triangle? How is it different from the traditional Cost, Scope, Schedule iron triangle. Do you need to follow the constraints?

Agile Triangle demonstrates the agile’s value when it comes to balancing value, constraints, and quality unlike the traditional iron triangle which focuses on cost, schedule, and the scope at all cost. The agile triangle is able to focus mostly on delivering value while being flexible with the constraints of a project like scope, cost, and schedule. Because the main focus is on delivering value as well as what makes it easier to adhere to the constraints, all the work that is completed will bring the team closer to the goal without too many obstacles in the way.

### (b) What do you think is the difference between Output and Outcome?

The outcome is the end result that is the culmination from the many outputs. It’s a long-term goal that each output should strive to be so it is achieved. Output is whatever is delivered and should contribute towards meeting the desired outcome.

## 4. In agile Collaboration describe how teams are involved in planning and status reporting rather than team leader performing these tasks

Each team member working on the project knows what needs to be accomplished in order to keep the project on schedule, therefore the team members make decisions on planning and status reporting. They inform other team members of what has been completed and what needs to be completed next in order for the project to succeed. This also prevents team members from waiting on leadership for decisions and makes the entire team more informed of the project’s progress.

### (a) Is consensus always required in a Collaborative environment? Why or why not?

No, having conflict is necessary as it leads to the refinement of ideas and gaining multiple perspectives of problems. By not always having consensus, other team members get to share their perspectives and thus the final product has new ideas and better refinement put into it instead of blindly agreeing to one or two team members’ ideas. Too much conflict from a lack of consensus though can hamper productivity.

### (b) Provide an example for: "Everyone on the team has a specialty, such as development, testing, or analysis, that they spend a considerable part of their time doing, but when the need arises, they are able to jump in and work on something else to help the team meet its overall goals."

For instance, a network specialist who usually works on ensuring the network is secure sees that the product needs more testing to be done before a close deadline will drop what they’re doing and help the testing team meet the deadline as it's more important than their work. Though the network specialist is not an expert in testing, he or she can still be of assistance to the testing team.

## 5. What is the key to an iterative approach? What benefits can you achieve in an iterative approach?

The key to the iterative approach is receiving frequent and meaningful feedback on the work completed. Through the iterative approach, the team can use the feedback to adjust their practices and techniques so that they work more effectively and meet the goals of the project. The team gets to try many different approaches to the project and reflect on the feedback to see what worked best.

## 6. Simplify means your team should start with a [barely sufficient](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/beyond-requirements-analysis/9780133039863/gloss01.html#gloss_13) approach Explain this. Why is maximizing the amount of work not done important?

Maximizing the amount of work not done means the team is less stressed and if a change needs to be made to the product in the future there is less work to change. This also means the work that is done is the most meaningful work as it directly contributes to what will add value to the project and meet the necessary goals of the product.
It means teams do the work that needs to be done to get the desired result. And not more. Eliminating waste is a core component of agile practices and a feature built that was not needed in the end is a waste that can be eliminated.

## 7. When you "Consider Context" explain: "what works great in one project may not work as well in other situations" with an example

One example of what works great in one project may not work in another is when one large team tries to copy the communication practices of a small team. Smaller teams generally have an easier time managing meetings since there are less schedules to work with rather than a large team, in which the more people, the more chances of communication methods such as getting schedules conflicting with others.

## 8. When you "Decide Wisely" explain in your own words, the following statement: “Decisions,” focuses on the use of a [business value model](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/beyond-requirements-analysis/9780133039863/gloss01.html#gloss_21) to help structure conversations in order to make informed decisions

Decisions allow for conversations to be fully considerate of all the available tools provided, pros and cons, and other considerations to come to a fully literate settlement and ensure all decisions are necessary to the project.

## 9. Why should we "Reflect and Adapt" in an Agile Project?

Reflecting is critical in a team because it allows them to either see what was done wrong or what could’ve been done better. Alongside that, adaptation is also crucial because adapting means to change a previous behavior to accommodate a new one; in the context of Agile, you could routinely be making a mistake which requires a reflection to recognize it and adaptation to change your previous routine to accommodate.

## 10. Summarize the first chapter in three or four lines

In chapter 1, we learn that the key focus of agile is about delivering value to the customer. Work is simplified to the team by working in iterations and adapting feedback by team members to compile a project that will have a continuous delivering value for the customer and stakeholders. The team should be constantly reflecting on the project and adapt to the project requirements as this will impact important decisions in the project and ultimately lead to a more productive team. The team should prioritize project features that provide functionality that focuses on the ultimate goal. Through employing these, a team using agile should be able to collaborate with the customer to deliver the best product while adapting to the constantly changing requirements and ideas that spawn in development.
