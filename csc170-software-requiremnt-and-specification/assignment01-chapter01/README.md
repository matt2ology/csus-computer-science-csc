Please do not confuse the due date with the available-until date.

   (b) What do you think is the difference between Output and Outcome?

4. In agile Collaboration describe how teams are involved in planning and status reporting rather than team leader performing these tasks.

   (a) Is consensus always required in a Collaborative environment? Why or why not?

   (b) Provide an example for: "Everyone on the team has a specialty, such as development, testing, or analysis, that they spend a considerable part of their time doing, but when the need arises, they are able to jump in and work on something else to help the team meet its overall goals."

5. What is the key to an iterative approach? What benefits can you achieve in an iterative approach?

6. Simplify means your team should start with a [barely sufficient](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/beyond-requirements-analysis/9780133039863/gloss01.html#gloss_13) approach.
7. Explain this. Why is maximizing the amount of work not done important?

8. When you "Consider Context" explain: "what works great in one project may not work as well in other situations" with an example.

9. When you "Decide Wisely" explain in your own words, the following statement: “Decisions,” focuses on the use of a [business value model](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/beyond-requirements-analysis/9780133039863/gloss01.html#gloss_21) to help structure conversations in order to make informed decisions.

10. Why should we "Reflect and Adapt" in an Agile Project?

11. Summarize the first chapter in three or four lines.

Best wishes :)
