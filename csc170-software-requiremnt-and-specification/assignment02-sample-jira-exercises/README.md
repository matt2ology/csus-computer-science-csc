Dear students,

This exercise is for you to warm up with playing with JIRA hands-on. You can mock things up as you go. You can do this on JIRA cloud

This is an individual exercise. Sometimes if you need other team members to add to the JIRA project to do these exercises since in some parts of the exercises you will be required to assign JIRA tasks to team members, that is okay with me.

Please go to the following folder location:

[File](https://csus.instructure.com/courses/78779/files) **-->** [Model Project](https://csus.instructure.com/courses/78779/files/folder/Model%20Project) **-->** [JIRA-tutorial](https://csus.instructure.com/courses/78779/files/folder/Model%20Project/JIRA-tutorial)
and run the instructions individually on your laptop.

Provide a PDF with screen shots.

## 1. Make up any project, Epic, User stories, Issues and Tasks; also, Make up any mock Release plan

Thanks to our TA Sam Lee for creating this exercise for you to play with.

You can do this on JIRA cloud

## 2. Go to <training.atlassian.com> and do the first two in the FREE trainings. The Free trainings is the last section on the page (scroll down all the way to the bottom of the page):
