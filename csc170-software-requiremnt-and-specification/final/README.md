## Instructions

Dear students,

Your schedule has strictly 120 minutes from the time you start the exam. You have additional 15 minutes to wrap up. So you have a total of 135 minutes including the wrap-up time. If you do not wrap up and hit the submit button well before time, you may be subject to lose all your work.

This exam is modeled like a quiz. You can get started at any time between 07/07/21 and 07/11/21. Do not hit the submit button unless you are sure that you had completed answering the quiz. Canvas auto-saves every answer.

This is an individual test, hence no discussion or sharing of questions or answers with other students or anyone else is allowed except with the instructor for the course.

Hint: To be successful in managing your time well, make sure you plan your time according to the number of points allocated. So if a question has 4 points do not exceed more than 4 minutes. If a question has 2 points do not exceed 2 minutes! You should be able to complete the True/False and Match-the-following questions in less than 15 minutes instead of 30 minutes. So you should be able to complete the test in less than 1 hour 30 minutes. If you are stuck anywhere move on and come back later to the question you are not sure of your answer.

There are:

- 5 simple 4 point essay questions (please do your best not to exceed 3 to 4 line answers per question or you may use the help of a simple graph or diagram if appropriate to explain),

- 10 True/False (2 points each),

- 10 Fill-in-the-blanks (2 points each),

- 5 match-the-following (2 points each), and

- 2 medium size questions with parts (for each part please do your best not to exceed 4 lines for an answer or you may use the help of a simple graph or diagram to explain) (5 points each part).

When filling in the blanks, please do not use more than two words per blank and use only all lower case letters. While grading we will be checking your fill-in-the-blanks answers manually as well.

Best wishes and cheers,

:)

## Question 18 (20 pts)

```text
The purpose of this assignment is to describe your CSC170 project to a prospective employer. You are to assume that you are applying for employment with a major software development company. You have been asked to write a description (with at most 750 words) of your project experience prior to the interview. This employer is familiar with the Computer Science Program at CSUS and regularly hires our graduates. The employer has requested that the description addresses the following **topics (questions)**:

1. Give an overview of the project and describe what the project was about. What was your role in the project?
2. Rather than discuss the process you used, identify what you consider to be essential to ensure that the process produces a successful outcome (i.e., the product is delivered on time, within budget, and more than meets the needs of our clients).
3. Were there any aspects of the project that have caused problems? If so, explain how these were dealt with – or not.

Discuss what you have learned from your development experience in that project that would influence your work as a member in our organization.
```

## Question 19 (10 pts) Name and describe implementing TWO techniques that are associated with your class project only as a summary (all details are not required)
