## Question 18 (20 pts)

```text
The purpose of this assignment is to describe your CSC170 project to a prospective employer. You are to assume that you are applying for employment with a major software development company. You have been asked to write a description (with at most 750 words) of your project experience prior to the interview. This employer is familiar with the Computer Science Program at CSUS and regularly hires our graduates. The employer has requested that the description addresses the following **topics (questions)**:

1. Give an overview of the project and describe what the project was about. What was your role in the project?
2. Rather than discuss the process you used, identify what you consider to be essential to ensure that the process produces a successful outcome (i.e., the product is delivered on time, within budget, and more than meets the needs of our clients).
3. Were there any aspects of the project that have caused problems? If so, explain how these were dealt with – or not.

Discuss what you have learned from your development experience in that project that would influence your work as a member in our organization.
```

## Question 19 (10 pts) Name and describe implementing TWO techniques that are associated with your class project only as a summary (all details are not required)

> In our project I like and used the both making a timely decision and communicating the decision; for, there is a fine balance between gathering enough information and spending too much time trying to gather information, so making a decision reduces being subsumed to "decision fatigue," and falls in line with "The 37-percent rule" (aka "the secretary problem") where you'll have the highest chance of picking the very best option if you look at and reject the first 37 percent of your total group of options.
>
> As long as one can explain and elaborate (communicate the decision) why that decision of all other is best then it's with reason that we go with the best decision even if some may not agree.
