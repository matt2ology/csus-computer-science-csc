## Question 2 (5 pts): Describe responsibilities of the product owner in the context of decision making (where organization "determines the decision maker" and also as part of "selecting a decision mechanism"). Refer to Text book for details

The responsibilities of the Product Owner, or Business Analyst (BA), is the key
decision maker in agile approaches: either as the decider or the decision leader,
and also has the responsibility for the outcome of the project.

A Business Analyst (BA), in selecting a decision mechanism, often decides with
discussion. When the Product Owner talks with key stakeholders to get their
perspectives and understand possible options, and makes the decision based holistic information gathered.

## Question 3 (5 pts): Name all the decision-making mechanisms

Decision Mechanism Decide How to Decide

> - `Spontaneous agreement`: Rare... can be a sign of GroupThink
> - `Delegation`: Primary decision maker identifies someone to decide
> - `Majority vote`: Downside is that losers and winners are identified
> - `Decider decides with discussion`: This is the Product Owner approach
> - `Arbitrary`: Can be a coin flip, not usually the best approach
> - `Decider decides without discussion`: This is a Dictator Model approach
> - `Negotiation`: Team attempts to find solution everyone agrees with
> - `Consensus`: This is a collaborative approach

## Question 4 (5 pts): What are the different types of biases affecting stakeholders?

Elicitation (collecting information) - Biases affecting Stakeholders

> - `Response Bias`: answering a question based on what the stakeholder thinks the analyst wants
> - `Groupthink`: stakeholders all convey the same information whether or not they believe it
> - `Bandwagon Effect`: go along to get along
> - `Curse of Knowledge`: stakeholders being unable to consider a less informed and more neutral perspective

## Question 5 (5 pts): What are the different types of biases affecting analysis?

Biases Affecting Analysis - The curse of knowledge, the analyst’s bias

> - `Confirmation Bias`: Tendency to search for, interpret, and remember information that confirms your own preconceptions
> - `Observer-Expectancy Effect`: The analyst expecting a certain result, subconsciously manipulate or misinterprets data in order validate that “certain result”
