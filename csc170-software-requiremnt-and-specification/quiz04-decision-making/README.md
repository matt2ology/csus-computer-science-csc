## Instructions

Dear students,

Please answer the following Quiz on Chapter 4 Decision Making.
The PowerPoint slides should be sufficient to answer. The purpose of the quiz is
that by answering the quiz you are getting a chance to simultaneously consolidate
your understanding of the class material. You can start the quiz now and complete
it by the due date. Answers will not be viewable until later.

For the "match the following" question, first please play with different combinations
on a piece of paper or online. Some combinations will look correct. But, if you
try a different combination, it may be an even better and closer match.

For multiple-choice and true or false, there is only one correct answer (letter).

For fill-in-the-blanks, do your best. I will go through each fill-in-the-blank answer manually as well.

This quiz will be out of 50 points. Please read the quiz thoroughly when taking it.

Best Wishes and Cheers,

:)

Jagan
