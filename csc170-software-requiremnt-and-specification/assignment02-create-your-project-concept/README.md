## Introduction

Dear students,

You have until the due date to form a team of 5 to 8 students. Each student will have to contribute. Each student take one or more questions and work on it. Do not submit the completed assignment, unless all students see the work of every other student and approves the quality.

Please create the following so that we will have something to get started on your projects:

YOU ARE PERMITTED TO GET THINGS WRONG IN THIS ASSIGNMENT. IT IS EXPECTED TO HAPPEN AND PERFECTLY ALRIGHT!

**\***You will not be graded for correctness. You will be graded for doing the team work and completing the work. Do your work incrementally. If you do not understand anything please ask me.**\***
