## Jarod Castillo - Agile Development User Stories Are The New Requirements Document

### Jarod Castillo - (A) QUESTIONS

#### What's the purpose of introducing User Stories?

The purpose of user stories is to help the team focus on customer vs. product. It allows the requirements to be handled at a high abstract level, and to be discussed amongst peers. It provides Functionality, how part of the system/product handles a customer's input.

#### How are User Stories, Use Cases, and Requirements different from each other?

Requirements are set-in-stone constraints, conditions or capabilities. A use case is how the user interacts with the system, and how the system responds to the specific case. A user story is less specified, and is based on customer value rather than a specific requirement. Development of the user story happens only when collaboration exists.

#### Why do we use User Stories instead of just Requirements?

A user story makes it easier for developers to understand why a user would want to use their product. It shifts the focus to the customers' values.

### Jarod Castillo - (B) SUMMARY

User stories can be thought of as a relationship with the customer. In my experience, user stories make it easier to see why I'm coding a certain part of the application. Knowing the why of the application encourages the developers to write the code because it has meaning for a user/customer.

From this article I loved the idea of working as a technical trainer and a blogger, since I’ve recently discovered I enjoy technical writing. I find this article does a fantastic job showcasing the many areas in the tech field where people can use their unique skillset to get jobs.

## Mohammed Msallam - SRS Document The what The Why The how

### Mohammed Msallam - (A) QUESTIONS

#### What is an SRS Document?

**Answer:** Software requirements specification (SRS) document in software engineering is a comprehensive description of a software system. It determines what features a system must have and how its features must function.

#### What are the three types of software requirements?

- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Domain requirements

#### Why is the SRS document important?

**Answer:** Writing an SRS is super necessary for creating startups and launching new
software products. Create a framework for development teams and
help them clearly define what they need to develop.

### Mohammed Msallam - (B) SUMMARY

The experience I had with building an app for caltrans was very helpful because I had no knowledge
about SRS and SDD. And the project was a little difficult we had to build a hydroseed calculator and the
calculator had seed mixer types of fertilizer so writing the SRS helped set the plan or the
project scope for me to understand and start executing. I think that experience was super helpful
and I gained skills in different aspects from using case models to ERD diagrams.

## Belle Nguyen - GeekvsGeek Articles on SRS

### Belle Nguyen - Questions and Answers

#### Why Do We Use SRS?

We use SRS so that we can fully understand the project’s requirements, how they will meet them, and how they complete the project. By doing so saves time for their team and find out the limitations/risks early on.

#### What is requirements management?

That is the process of analyzing, documenting, tracking, prioritizing and agreeing on the requirement and controlling the communication to relevant stakeholders. This takes care of the changing nature of requirements and ensures that SRS is as modifiable as possible.

#### What are non-functional requirements(NFR)?

- They are the quality constraints that the system must satisfy according to the project contract. They deal with issues such as security, performance, flexibility, and more.
- NFR classify the following types such as
  - Interface constraints
  - Performance constraints
  - Operating constraints
  - Life cycle constraints
  - Economic constraints

### Belle Nguyen - B. Personal Opinion

Before reading these articles, I didn’t know there were more to the software engineering scene. All I thought there was, was all you do is code all day. However, while reading about SRS there are way more steps to managing a project so that we are able to deliver the product with the most efficiency we can provide.

## Daisy Le - Backlog Vs Specification Why Backlog Beats Specification

### Daisy Le - (A) QUESTIONS

#### What is the purpose of backlog and specification?

**Answer:** With specifications, they are written instructions made to be followed by developers and in a perfect world, they are all implemented without any complications or difficulties. However, we do not live in a perfect world and unfortunately that is an unlikely possibility to occur. Instead, backlog exists where it defines things that can be prioritized over other necessities. With backlogs, whatever is absolutely required is done first, leaving the least needed items pushed back. With this method, we’re able to leave anything that we think is absolutely unnecessary to not be implemented or least prioritize with the limited time given for the project. Backlog provides flexibility, something that specification does not have as it only lists its NEEDS and not WANTS.

#### Why can’t we have all the features I requested?!

**Answer:** Although it is ideal to of course meet all the desired features of a product, however there is a difference between must have and wants. Sometimes, there are requested features that are not even detrimental to the final product and these must be sacrificed in order to make the required ones functional and working first- this comes back to the agile mindset or thinking. Prioritizing important features must come first as time and funding is not unlimited. However, other features can always be looked back into after all the priorities are completed, thus comes in the backlog, making use once again.

#### What makes the backlog so flexible?

**Answer:** Backlog is flexible because you create the baseline rules of the product using user stories. You look through the perspective of a user, what are they going to use the product for exactly? Would this user really need this one feature? Or is that simply what a developer wants? With user stories, it makes priorities a lot more clear without creating specific development requirements- only things that a user would want, not in the developer perspective.

### Daisy Le - (B) SUMMARY

Although knowing what you absolutely want in a product can be good for creating a defined vision of a final product, having specifications can be the downfall to a project. Having too specific requirements can lead to downtime in a project, struggling to meet the perfect standards of what was asked for without sacrificing any details. Instead, there is backlog where user stories can be created and other requirements put into a queue of priority. Backlog has proven itself to be far more consistent, allowing team members to get tasks done according to what is an absolute must have feature to least.

## Dominic Nance - Why Jira Software Became So Popular?

### Dominic Nance - (A) QUESTIONS

#### Why have many organizations transitioned to Jira?

**Answer:** The time that Jira was created was around the time that traditional frameworks such as the Waterfall method were becoming outdated, and Agile frameworks were much more mainstream. It has many user-friendly ways of planning, scheduling, releasing versions of a product. Not only can you use SCRUM, but you can also use Kanban if you desire. Comparatively to other platforms such as Flying Donut, the UI is much easier for users to understand, myself included.

#### What makes Jira so popular?

**Answer:** Like the previous answer, it’s easy to use. Due to the versatility and an easy way of tracking everyone’s progress, it’s simple to understand and quick to get used to. It’s much easier to keep in contact as well given that you can chat through Jira and notify anyone of progress. On top of that, there are thousands of various add-ons for Jira that can enhance how you approach your project.

#### Are there recent additions to Jira?

**Answer:** You are able to track specific issues in the backlog, emphasize different issues or work items, and you’re capable of adding permissions depending on what role you have.

### Dominic Nance - (B) SUMMARY

Over the past two decades, Jira has become a popular outlet for those who want a better way of communicating with their teams to create a product. Overall, it’s popularity grew and developed due to its user-friendly UI, being able to better track progress for a project, and it’s flexibility in being able to use SCRUM and Kanban. And while all of these features are great, the program is also constantly expanding for more potential.

## Matthew Mendoza - A Career As A Business Analyst

### Matthew Mendoza - (A) QUESTIONS

#### What are the roles and functions of a Business Analyst?

**Answer:** Business Analysts engage with business leaders and users to understand how data-driven changes to process, products, services, software and hardware can improve efficiencies and add value; in furthermore, they articulate those ideas but also balance them against what’s technologically feasible and financially and functionally reasonable.

#### Do business analysts need a background in IT?

**Answer:** No, as long as they have a general understanding of how systems, products and tools work.

#### What are business analytics tools and software?

**Answer:** Business analysts typically rely on software such as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Access, SQL, Google Analytics and Tableau. These tools help BAs collect and sort data, create graphs, write documents and design visualizations to explain the findings. You won’t necessarily need programming or database skills for a business analyst position, but if you already have these skills, they won’t hurt.

### Matthew Mendoza - (B) SUMMARY

In summary, Business Analysts play a crucial role bridging the communication gap between both the technical and business operations in a company or organization. The position, to name a few, assists and provides guidance in an organization’s product and/or services by creating a detailed business analysis, outlining problems, opportunities and solutions for a business. Those who pursue a career in business analytics are often well rounded individuals who can extrapolate data and generate reports, and the ability to articulate, share and present the technical side of an organization to a non-business audience to further advance and guide both the business and operations side of an organization.

## Yared Engida - Can a Traditional SRS Be Converted into User Stories ?

### Yared Engida - (A) QUESTIONS

#### 1. Is converting a Traditional SRS into User Stories worth the time ?

**ANSWER:** Rewriting an SRS into user stories is usually not worth the effort it takes. It would take someone a great deal of time to convert a traditional SRS into User Stories so that time can be spent on something else that is more product.

#### 2. Is there benefit in converting the traditional SRS into user stories ?

**ANSWER:** User stories are mostly centered on users. It lays out the requirements process and focuses on the needs of the business. The only bad side of it is that it takes up time and requires collaborative work.

#### 3. What is the benefit of having a Traditional SRS instead of User Stories ?

**ANSWER:** In the software implementation phase, a traditional SRS will provide a clear aim. It establishes a common ground for customers and suppliers to agree on what the implemented software product should do.

### Yared Engida - (B) SUMMARY

Issues could be addressed by rewriting the SRS into user stories and creating a great product backlog. However, the time it takes to rewrite an SRS into user stories is usually not worth it. Someone would have to spend time doing this, and that person could likely be doing something more productive with their time. With an SRS, there is no attempt to write needs that can be implemented in a sprint and are prioritized. SRS is ineffective at planning, prioritizing, or scheduling tasks. On an agile project, a product backlog is utilized for both of these reasons.
