# Pysics5B Lab - After Class Summary Electrostatics

WW07.4 | Thursday, February 17, 2022 | 02:38 PM

%%
After each lab, you will write a brief summary of the experiment that you did. The objective is for you to show me that you understand the concepts behind the lab, and the techniques we used.

The summary should include the following information:
%%

## What did you do?

Performed a variety of experiments to observe and demonstrate how:

1. To charge and discharge objects
2. Charged objects interact with other charged and neutral objects
3. Polarized objects interact with both negatively and positively charged objects

## How did you do it?

### Charged and discharging objects

#### Charged Objects

To observe and experiment with charged objects we used an uncharged electroscope grounded by simply touching it. Respectively a wool cloth and silk cloth is rubbed around a rubber and a glass rod; in effect, giving us a negatively charged rubber rod and a positively charged glass rod.

#### Discharging Objects

In two ways:

1. We took a positively charged electroscope to a sink pipe and so returned to neutral (became grounded).
2. Brought a lit match near a positively and negatively charged electroscopes and saw that for both charged electroscope returned to a neutral, grounded, state.

### Charged objects interact with other objects

This was observed and experimented in two ways polarization, and with repulsion and distance

#### Polarization

Two ways:

1. Brought a charged rod near some small bits of paper
2. A highly charged positively/negatively rod is brought close to a slow stream of water

#### Repulsion and Distance

1. Starting with an grounded, uncharged, electroscope a positively and negatively rod is brought closer until we observed the gold leaf move. This is repeated at 4 more smaller distances and we measure the Coulomb force by estimating the angle the gold leaf makes from the bottom plate.

## What were your central results?

### Charged and discharging objects

1. The positive charges stored in the electroscope were released when brought to the sink pipe.
2. Both the negatively and positively charges stored in the electroscope were brought to neutral when the flame was brought close to the electroscope

#### Polarization

The bits of paper of a side do lift to meet the positively charged rod.

#### Repulsion and Distance

The gold leaf of the electroscope greatly jumps away from the bottom plate at a steeper angle the closer the charged rod got.

## What are your main conclusions?

In conclusion conclusion

1. Objects can be negatively charged or positively charged, and when grounded become/return to neutral
2. Opposites attract and like charges have a repulsive force onto each other
3. Charges in an object can move/orient within an object and the respective side of said object can be attracted or repulsed to/from a charged object.
