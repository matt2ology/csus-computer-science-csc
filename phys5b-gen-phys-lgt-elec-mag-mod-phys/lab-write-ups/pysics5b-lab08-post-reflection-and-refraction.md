# lab08-post-reflection-and-refraction

 W16.4 | Thursday, April 21, 2022 | 01:36 PM

## What did you do?

We used a helium-neon laser and fire though glass so to see either refraction or reflection

## How did you do it?

we did so on the same level have the laser, center aligned, fired the object.

## What were your central results?

As light travels though a transparent object it's direction from when it entered and where it has exited changed.

## What are your main conclusions?

Reflection is where a change in direction of it's source and bounce off an object.  Refraction is a change in the direction of waves as they pass from one material/medium to another. Transparent objects like glass or water, depending on it's angle, or is at critical angle, will change the light's reflection and refraction.
