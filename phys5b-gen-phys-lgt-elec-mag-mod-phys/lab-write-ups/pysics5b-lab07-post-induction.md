## What did you do?

In this lab, for all of the activates in various configurations, we had the metal support wrapped around with metal wire coils; so, to test the magnetic field of a coil, induced current by a coil, and induced current by a magnet.

## How did you do it?

### The magnetic Field of a Coil

1. Connect a coil to the battery
2. Determine the direction of the current in the coil
   1. using the right hand rule - work out the shape and direction of magnetic field lines
      1. Test via a compass
3. Disconnect the battery
4. Reconnect with the reverse polarity

### Induced Current by a Coil

#### Primary Coil

1. Have the metal support rod run though the coils being used; then, use the hooks attached to the coils to move as needed.
2. Added a switch in series with the coil and the battery
3. The coil connected to the battery is the primary coil

#### Secondary Coil

1. The coil set next to it connected to the galvanometer will be the secondary coil
2. The coils had their windings go in the same direction and be no more than two cm apart on the support rod
3. The secondary coil had the induced current and induced magnetic flux within it

### Induced Current by a Magnet

Removed the primary coil and kept the secondary coil connected to the galvanometer

## What were your central results?

1. The north end of the magnet is moved towards the coil
   1. The current goes to the right
2. The north end of the magnet is moved away from the coil
   1. The current will be going to the left
3. The south end of the magnet is moved towards the coil
   1. The current will be going to the left
4. The south end of the magnet is moved away from the coil
   1. The current will be going to the right

## What are your main conclusions?

The moving of a magnet towards and away a coil induces a voltage in the coil with the magnetic field proportional to the velocity of the movement.
