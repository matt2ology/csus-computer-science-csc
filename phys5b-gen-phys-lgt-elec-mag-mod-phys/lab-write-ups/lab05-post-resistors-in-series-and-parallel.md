# Pre-lab 05 Resistors in Series and Parallel

 W10.2 | Tuesday, March 8, 2022 | 11:48 AM

## What did you do?

We built a more complicated circuit and continued to measure their properties. The ”more complicated“ circuit used resistors in series, resistors in parallel, and both were analyzed with the use of the digital ammeter, digital ohmmeter, and analog voltmeter.

## How did you do it?

We will use a battery as our source of power for the circuit. With the battery and the supplied resistors we are to build out a circuit with the resistors in a parallel configuration and another in a series configuration.

## What were your central results?

Our measurements were consistent with what we expected for series resistors; in addition, our measurements were consistent with what we expected for parallel resistors for our calculated resistance is lower than our smallest resistor 88.14 $\ohm$ read from the ohmmeter is less than 162 $\ohm$ of our smallest resistor.

## What are your main conclusions?

In conclusion our the total resistance of a system in a series is a summation of each resistor component; in contrast, the total resistance with resistors in parallel is less than the resistance of the lowest resistor component on the circuit.  This was validated via the ohmmeter and though our calculations of Ohm's law. Where we found our calculations and ohmmeter measurements matched.
