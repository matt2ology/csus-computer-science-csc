# lab03-post-Resistance and Ohms Law

 W09.4 | Thursday, March 3, 2022 | 02:52 PM

## What did you do?

Measured the resistance of three resistors; after, change out the resistors for a small light bulb and measure it's ohmic properties using a digital ammeter, ohmmeter, and voltmeter.

## How did you do it?

Using the schematics described in the circuit diagram we tested the three resistors and light bulb, and measure and collect data gathered using the digital ammeter, ohmmeter, and voltmeter.

## What were your central results?

We found that

1. The ohmmeter was the most precise for determining the resistance; for, it is best for contact resistance measurements
2. That $\Large R\:=\:\frac{V}{I}$ method was least precise for determining the resistance ($\Large \Omega$) because it does not account for the contact resistance.
3. That the resistors are ohmic; for, it has a linear relationship between Voltage vs Current

## What are your main conclusions?

In conclusion the measurement that is most accurate is the ohmmeter for it factors in the contact resistance; and, the resistors are ohmic for it has a linear relationship between Volts ($V$) and Current ($A$)
