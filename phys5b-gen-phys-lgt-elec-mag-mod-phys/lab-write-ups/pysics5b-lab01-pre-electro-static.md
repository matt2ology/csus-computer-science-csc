# Physics Pre-Lab - Electro Statics

WW06.2 | Tuesday, February 8, 2022 | 01:44 PM

## State the physical goal of the experiment

The goal of the Electrostatics Lab is to perform experiments and demonstrate how:

1. Objects charge and discharge
2. Interactions of charge
3. Coulomb's law is applied
4. Polarization of charge

### Charging Objects

The goal in this experiment is to have an uncharged electroscope and then by touch, finger onto electroscope or a rubbed rod onto electroscope, and observe the movement and position of the gold foil leaf.

### Discharging Objects

The goal is to demonstrate grounding by touching a positively charged electroscope to a sink pipe and then observe the difference in results when the same is done with the experimenter's finger to discharge

In addition, we are to bring a lit match near both the positively and negatively charge electroscopes and observe the changes

### Polarization

Two goals

1. Bring a charged rod near some small bits of paper and observe the phenomenon
 1. The experiment can be repeated with an oppositely charged rod
2. Turn on a faucet to produce a slow stream of water and observe what happens when a positively charged rod is brought near to the stream of water
 1. The experiment is then repeated, but with a highly negatively charged rod

### Repulsion and Distance

The goal is to start with an uncharged electroscope, charge the negative rod, and observe how far away (using a suspended cradle) can the charged rod before the gold leaf starts moving.

The experiment is then repeated with a positively charged rod.

## Describe the theory we will be testing in the experiment

All experiments involve charge and their interactions with objects.  I believe the theory we will be testing in the experiments is the attraction or repulsion force between like and unlike charged objects. We are exploring the the strength of the forces, how a positive seeks to be in a lower state, and the distance of electric fields start to influence objects of the like and unlike charged objects.

## Briefly (one or two sentences) describe the experimental setup

In general we are to bring a positively or negatively charge object (rods) closer to neutral, negatively, or positively charged objects.

## Write about one thing you struggled with in the pre-lab, or something that was unclear in the

The writing of the pre-lab is clear to me.
