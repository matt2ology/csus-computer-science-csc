# Pre-Lab04 - Electric

## State the physical goal of the experiment

The physical goal of the Electric Energy lab is to create a simple circuit to measure the current and potential difference over a resistor.

## Describe the theory we will be testing in the experiment

We will be testing and demonstrate power dissipated by a resistor, simple circuits, circuit diagrams, and calorimeters (without phase changes)

## Briefly (one or two sentences) describe the experimental setup

We are to create a simple circuit with the addition of two meters to measure both the current and potential difference over a resistor.

This is done by measuring and recording the mass of the aluminum calorimeter cup; fill the aluminum cup with three-fourths water; measure and record the mass of the water and cup; assemble the calorimeter cup including the disk and metal jacket; then insert the resistor, heating coil, stirrer, and temperature probe; and finally plug in and turn on the temperature probe.

## Write about one thing you struggled with in the pre-lab, or something that was unclear in the

I have no confusion to what is required and instructed to do in the lab instructions
