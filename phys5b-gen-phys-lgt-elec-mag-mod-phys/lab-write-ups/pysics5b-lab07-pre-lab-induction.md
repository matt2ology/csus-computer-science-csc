# Lab07: Pre-Lab Induction

 W14.4 | Thursday, April 7, 2022 | 08:47 AM

## State the physical goal of the experiment

In this lab, for all of the activates in various configurations, we are to have the metal support wrapped around with metal wire coils; so, to test the magnetic field of a coil, induced current by a coil, and induced current by a magnet.

## Describe the theory we will be testing in the experiment

In this experiment we should familiarize ourselves, so we can apply the follow theories (laws):

1. Faraday's law
2. Lenz's law

and understand the concepts of:

1. Magnetic fields of coils
2. Bar magnets
3. Magnetic flux
4. Induced electro magnetic field
5. Induced currents

## Briefly (one or two sentences) describe the experimental setup

### The magnetic Field of a Coil

1. Connect a coil to the battery
2. Determine the direction of the current in the coil
 1. using the right hand rule - work out the shape and direction of magnetic field lines
  1. Test via a compass
3. Disconnect the battery
4. Reconnect with the reverse polarity

### Induced Current by a Coil

#### Primary Coil

1. Have the metal support rod run though the coils being used; after, use the hooks attached to the coils to move as needed.
2. Add a switch in series with the coil and the battery
3. The coil connected to the battery is the primary coil

#### Secondary Coil

1. The coil set next to it connected to the galvanometer will be the secondary coil
2. The coils should have their windings go in the same direction and be no more than two cm apart on the support rod
3. The secondary coil should have the induced current and induced magnetic flux within it

### Induced Current by a Magnet

Remove the primary coil and keep the secondary coil connected to the galvanometer

## Write about one thing you struggled with in the pre-lab, or something that was unclear in the

The lab is well written and was easy to follow
