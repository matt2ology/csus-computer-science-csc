# Pre Lab 12 Hydrogen Spectrum

 W18.4 | Thursday, May 5, 2022 | 02:04 PM

## State the physical goal of the experiment

We are to investigate the wave nature of light using a grating and viewing the interface pattern of a multiple wavelengths at once; in addition, with a spectral lamp we are to analyze the Bohr model of hydrogen.

## Describe the theory we will be testing in the experiment

The theory we will be testing, and should be familiar with, are diffraction gratings, spectroscopes, the Bohr model of hydrogen, energy level diagrams, and emission versus absorption of light by an atom.

## Briefly (one or two sentences) describe the experimental setup

Align the collimator and telescope with one another, insert the grating holder into the spectroscope and have that aligned with the collimator so that the light coming from the collimator intersects the grating at a 90 degree angle.

Then place the spectral lamp so that the spectral tube is about 2 cm from the slit at the end of the collimator, after turning on the lamp moving the spectrometer into position, focus the light by twisting the focusing ring.

Lastly adjust the slit width so that it simultaneously is wide enough to allow light in, but thin enough to make finding the center with the crosshairs easy.

## Write about one thing you struggled with in the pre-lab, or something that was unclear in the manual

Although lengthy in it's description the pre-lab is easy to follow and clearly written.
