## What did you do?

We used thin lenses, so to project real and virtual images and their locations; in addition, measure objects, and calculate images and focal lengths with the respective lens equations.

## How did you do it?

On a track we had, center aligned and in order, a lamp, a lens and its holder and pane of frosted glass.

## What were your central results?

Most of our images created with a converging lens produced Virtual, inverted, smaller images.

## What are your main conclusions?

In conclusion, with a converging lens all images are inverted and smaller to the object unless the object's distance is greater than the focal length and less than twice the focal length for it will then produce a real image.  When an object is equal to the focal length no image will be produced; in addition, when an object's distance is less than the focal length the virtual image produced will then be larger than the object size and inverted.
