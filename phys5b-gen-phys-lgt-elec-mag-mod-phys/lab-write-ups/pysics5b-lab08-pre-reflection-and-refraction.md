## State the physical goal of the experiment

We are to use a helium-neon laser and fire though glass so to see either refraction or reflection

## Describe the theory we will be testing in the experiment

We will be applying and observing the following concepts and theories:

1. Law of reflection
2. Index of refraction
3. Snell's law
4. Critical angle

## Briefly (one or two sentences) describe the experimental setup

On the same level have the laser, center aligned, fired the object.

## Write about one thing you struggled with in the pre-lab, or something that was unclear in the lab workbook

The lab is lengthy, but is understandable.
