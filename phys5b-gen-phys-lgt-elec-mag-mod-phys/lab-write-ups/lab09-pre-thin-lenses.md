# Pre Lab09: Thin Lenses

 W16.4 | Thursday, April 21, 2022 | 01:59 PM

## State the physical goal of the experiment

We are to use thin lenses, so to project real and virtual images and their locations; in addition, measure objects, and calculate images and focal lengths with the respective lens equations.

## Describe the theory we will be testing in the experiment

We will be following the following concepts and theories:

1. The lens equations
2. Testing against converging vs. diverging lenses
3. Magnification
4. The difference between real vs. virtual images
5. Ray tracing

## Briefly (one or two sentences) describe the experimental setup

On a track we will have, center aligned and in order, a lamp, a lens and its holder and pane of frosted glass.

## Write about one thing you struggled with in the pre-lab, or something that was unclear in the lab workbook

The lab is easy to understand and clearly written.
