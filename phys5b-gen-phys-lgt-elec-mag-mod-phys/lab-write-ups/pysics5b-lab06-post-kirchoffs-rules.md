# After Class Summary Kirchhoff's Rules

 W13.4 | Thursday, March 31, 2022 | 11:08 PM

## What did you do?

We used Kirchhoff's junction rule and Kirchhoff's loop rule in the experiment; in addition, we also used Ohm's law and followed circuit diagram schematics.

## How did you do it?

We assembled the circuit as depicted in figure 6.1. Once configured we made sure to disconnect the battery to avoid draining the it; after, we took measurements, connected the battery, and measured the voltage of the respective circuit loop and repeated for each resistor.

## What were your central results?

Measuring the resistance of each resistor using the ohmmeter our measurements were consistent with Kirchhoff's junction rule at each junction.

$\LARGE \frac{0.24V}{47\Omega }\cong 0.0051A$

$\LARGE \frac{0.27V}{102\Omega} \cong 0.0026A$

$\LARGE \frac{1.32V}{165\Omega }\cong0.008A$

In addition, our current measurements, using an ammeter, though each resistor are consistent with what we found when measuring with the ohmmeter.

$\Large I_1=0.004797A$
$\Large I_2=0.002502A$

$\LARGE I_1 + I_2 = I_3$

$\LARGE I_3 \cong 0.007297A$

## What are your main conclusions?

Our measurements are consistent with Kirchhoff's junction rule because for both $\LARGE L_1$ and $\LARGE L_2$ the calculated measured amps are within range of each other.  This follows Kirchhoff's junction rule for the current of $\LARGE L_1$ and $\LARGE L_2$ added together to form $\LARGE L_3$.  The summation of the currents going in is equal to the current going out.
