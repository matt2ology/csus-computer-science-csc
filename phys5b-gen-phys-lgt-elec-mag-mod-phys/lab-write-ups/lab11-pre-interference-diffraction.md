# Pre Lab 11 Interference and Diffraction

## State the physical goal of the experiment

We will be observing the interface patterns of an in-phase, monochromatic light through one and two slits; in addition, we will also need to see the difference in the pattern when the distance between the slits is altered.

## Describe the theory we will be testing in the experiment

The theory we will be testing, and should be familiar with, are constructive versus destructive interference, Young's double slit experiment, and order.

## Briefly (one or two sentences) describe the experimental setup

With a laser at level with one, or two, thin slits cut into a board with some distance away from a screen.  The laser is some, relatively close, distance to the board so the laser's beam, parallel to the floor, fires straight though the single or double slits.

## Write about one thing you struggled with in the pre-lab, or something that was unclear in the manual

The lab document never said what was the material of the object where the slits were made into...
