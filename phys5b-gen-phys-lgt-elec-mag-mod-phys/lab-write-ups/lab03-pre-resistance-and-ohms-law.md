# Pre-Lab03 - Resistance and Ohms Law

WW08.4 | Thursday, February 24, 2022 | 11:03 AM

## State the physical goal of the experiment

The physical goal of the Resistance and Ohm's Law lab is to measure the resistance of three resistors; after, change out the resistors for a small light bulb and measure it's ohmic properties using a digital ammeter, ohmmeter, and voltmeter.

## Describe the theory we will be testing in the experiment

We will be testing and demonstrating Ohm's Law.

## Briefly (one or two sentences) describe the experimental setup

Using the schematics described in the circuit diagram test out the three resistors and light bulb, and measure and collect data gathered using the digital ammeter, ohmmeter, and voltmeter.

## Write about one thing you struggled with in the pre-lab, or something that was unclear in the

The lab workbook is easy to follow and understand as written.
