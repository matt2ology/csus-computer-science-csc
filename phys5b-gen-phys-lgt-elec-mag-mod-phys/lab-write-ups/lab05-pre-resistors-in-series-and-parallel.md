# Pre-lab 05 Resistors in Series and Parallel

 W10.2 | Tuesday, March 8, 2022 | 11:48 AM

## State the physical goal of the experiment

The physical goal of the experiment is to build more complicated circuits and continue to measure their properties. The ”more complicated“ circuit is to denote that we will be using resistors in series, resistors in parallel, and both will be analyzed with the use of the digital ammeter, digital ohmmeter, and analog voltmeter.

## Describe the theory we will be testing in the experiment

We will be testing theory of Ohm’s Law and concepts of resistors both in series and parallel.

## Briefly (one or two sentences) describe the experimental setup

We will use a battery as our source of power for the circuit. With the battery and the supplied resistors we are to build out a circuit with the resistors in a parallel configuration and another in a series configuration.

## Write about one thing you struggled with in the pre-lab, or something that was unclear in the

The lab is written well and easily understood
