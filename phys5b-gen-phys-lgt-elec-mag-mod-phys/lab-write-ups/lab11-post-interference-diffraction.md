## What did you do?

We will be observed the interface patterns of an in-phase, monochromatic light through one and two slits; in addition, we also saw the difference in the pattern when the distance between the slits was altered.

## How did you do it?

With a laser at level with one, or two, thin slits cut into a board with some distance away from a screen.  The laser is some, relatively close, distance to the board so the laser's beam, parallel to the floor, fires straight though the single or double slits.

## What were your central results?

With the data collected we found that

$\Huge d_A=\frac{\left|3.033-3.082\right|+\left|3.053-3.103\right|}{2}=0.0495\:cm$

$\Huge d_B=\frac{\left|4.553-4.46\right|+\left|4.58-4.46\right|}{2}=0.1065\:cm$

## What are your main conclusions?

When comparing our measurements of the laser wavelength tot he known wavelength for a helium neon laser we've found that we are of about a seven percent difference, less than 10% difference, so to argue that our data collection and calculations are near true to that the observed interphase pattern.

$\Huge \frac{4.479\times 10^{-5}}{6.328\times 10^{-5}}\times 100\%\:=\:7\%$
