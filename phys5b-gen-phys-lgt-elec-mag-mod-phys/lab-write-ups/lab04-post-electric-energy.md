## What did you do?

We tested and demonstrated power dissipated by a resistor with a simple circuit and measured the current and potential difference.

## How did you do it?

We did it by measuring and recording the mass of the aluminum calorimeter cup; fill the aluminum cup with three-fourths water; measure and record the mass of the water and cup; assemble the calorimeter cup including the disk and metal jacket; then insert the resistor, heating coil, stirrer, and temperature probe; and finally plug in and turn on the temperature probe.

## What were your central results?

We saw that there is a relationship to the power dissipated in a volume of water and the rise in temperature over time.  

## What are your main conclusions?

The water is effectively a pseudo-battery where the rise in temperature is the amount of energy stored when power is dissipated by the resistor submerged. That there is a relationship to the amount of current fed though the submerged resistor and rise of the water's temperature over time.
