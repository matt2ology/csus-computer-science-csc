# Physics5B Pre-Lab02 - Electric Fields and Potentials

WW07.4 | Thursday, February 17, 2022 | 01:30 PM

## State the physical goal of the experiment

The pyhysical goal of the Electric Fields and Potentials Lab experiment is to use a voltmeter to measure the potential at particular locations around various charge distributions.

## Describe the theory we will be testing in the experiment

We will be testing the theory where the presence of an electric charege creates an electric field and potential; so, to see the differences between the quantities and how they are related.

## Briefly (one or two sentences) describe the experimental setup

In a plexi-tray filled with a thin layer of water place two metal rods 10 cm apart from each other on an over-head transparency. The two metal rods are linked to a power supply, a positive lead to one and the other linked to ground (on the power supply and voltmeter); next, the  configuration of the positive rod and grounded rod are traced out on the over-head transparancy with a perminate marker.

## Write about one thing you struggled with in the pre-lab, or something that was unclear in the

1. The top of the over-head transparency, where the metal rods/plates sit, is it dry or is it submerged under the thin layer of water?
