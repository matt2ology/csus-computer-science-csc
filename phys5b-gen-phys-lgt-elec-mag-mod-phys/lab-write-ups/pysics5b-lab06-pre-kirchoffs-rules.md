## State the physical goal of the experiment

The physical goal of the Kirchhoff's Rules lab is to build a mini-junction of circuits and continue to measure their properties.

## Describe the theory we will be testing in the experiment

We will be using Kirchhoff's junction rule and Kirchhoff's loop rule in the experiment; in addition, we will also use Ohm's law and should be able to read circuit diagrams.

## Briefly (one or two sentences) describe the experimental setup

We are to assemble the circuit as depicted in figure 6.1. Once configured we are to be sure to disconnect the battery to avoid draining the it. When ready to take measurements connect the battery and measure the voltage of the respective circuit loop and repeat for each resistor.

## Write about one thing you struggled with in the pre-lab, or something that was unclear in the lab workbook

The lab workbook is easy to follow and understand as written.
