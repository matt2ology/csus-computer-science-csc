# Chapter 18 - Optics

W13.3 | Wednesday, March 30, 2022 | 12:00 PM

## Announcements

1. Moving onto Optics today - Starting chapter 18
2. Group Work 6 (ch 24 and 25) posted to canvas
	1. For practice only
	2. Blank copy and solution version

## The Ray Model of Light

1. Light rays travel in straight lines
2. Light rays can cross - nothing happens
3. Light rays continue to travel; until, they interact with matter
	1. Scattering within a material
	2. Absorption within a material
	3. **Reflection at an interface of materials** (Focused in class)
	4. **Refraction at an interface of materials** (Focused in class)

## Law of Reflection

- The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection
- Obvious when it's specular or regular reflection
- $\Huge \theta _i=\theta _r$
	- From the normal (perpendicular)

## Diffuse Reflection

- Most surfaces are not perfectly smooth
- Still $\Huge \theta _i=\theta _r$

## Reflection and Refraction

- When light hits an interface between two media part of the light is reflected and part is transmitted

### Refraction

- The altering of the path of light as it enters a medium, due to a change in speed

## Snell's law of Refraction

> [!important]
> $\Huge n_1\sin \left(\theta _1\right)=n_2\sin \left(\theta _2\right)$
> Has a monotonically increasing function below $90^{\circ}$

- $\Huge n\:=\:\frac{c}{v}$ is the index of refraction ($n$) - the bigger the $n$ the slower the light will go...
	- $c$ is the "true" speed of light
	- $v$ is the

### Upsetting the Math

- $\Huge n_1\sin \left(\theta _1\right)=n_2\sin \left(\theta _2\right)$
- What if we go from a large $n$ to a much smaller $n$, at a moderate angle
	- $n_1=1.5,\:n_2\:=\:1.0,\:\theta _1=65^{\circ}$
- $1.5\sin \left(65^{\circ}\right)=1.0\sin \left(\theta _2\right)$
- $\theta _2=\arcsin \left(1.36\right)=???$
	- Does not work because $\sin \left(\right)$ does not operate with numbers greater than 1

#### Critical Angle

> [!important]
> $\Huge \sin \left(\theta _c\right)=\frac{n_2}{n_1}$

The angle of incidence which gives rise to an angle of refraction of $90^{\circ}$

- At any angle greater than $\theta _c$, Snell's Law breaks down, and total internal refraction occurs
- This is the only time 100% reflection occurs
