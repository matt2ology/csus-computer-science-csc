### Question 03: Electric Potential Ranking Task - Solution

> Most Positive -> **B**, **A**, **C** = **D**,  **F**, **E** -> Most Negative

## Question 05: Problem 21.5

A $20\:nC$ charge is moved from a point where $V_1 = 210\:V$ to a point where $V_2 = -30\:V$

How much work is done by the force that moves the charge?

### Question 05: Problem 21.5 - Goal

Learn how to calculate the work done by a force when it moves an electric charge through an electric potential difference.

### Question 05: Problem 21.5 - Solution

**Equation for work is measured in Joules (J)**: $\Large W=q\Delta V$
**Nano-Coulombs to Coulombs**: $\Large \frac{10^{-9}C}{1nC}$

1. $\LARGE W=q\:\Delta\:V$
2. $\LARGE W=\left(20\:nC\cdot \frac{10^{-9}\:C}{1\:nC}\right)\left(-30\:V\:-\:210\:V\right)$
3. $\LARGE W=(0.00000002)(-240)$
4. $\LARGE W=-4.8\cdot 10^{-6}\:J$

> $W\:= -4.8\:μJ$
> $W\:=\:-0.0000048$
> $W=-4.8\cdot 10^{-6}\:J$

## Question 06: Problem 21.7

At one point in space, the electric potential energy of a $20\:nC$ charge is $44\:μJ$

### PART A: What is the electric potential at this point?

Calculate the electric potential at a point if we know the electric potential energy and the charge

**Electric Potential Energy Equation**: $\Large U=q\cdot\:V$

- $\large U$: Electric Potential Energy
- $\large q$: Charge on particle
- $\large V$: Electric Potential

### PART B: If a $25\:nC$  charge were placed at this point, what would its electric potential energy be?

Calculate the potential energy of a charge, placed at a point with a known electric potential
