## The Thin Lens Equation

Used to locate the image mathematically (free to use any measurement meters, millimeters, feet):
- $s$ = object distance
- $s’$ = image distance
- $f$ = focal length

${1/s}+{1/s’}={1/f}$

### Conventions

- $\LARGE s$ is always positive
- $\LARGE S’$ is **positive for real images**
	- Opposite side of lens as the object
- $\LARGE S’$ is **negative for virtual images**
	- Same side of lens as object
- $\LARGE f$
- $\LARGE f$

## Practice Problem 01

- $f$ = 6 cm
- $s$ = 10 com
- $h_o$ = 3 cm
- FIND $s’$

**Solution**: Real image

$\Large {1/f}={1/s}+{1/s’}$
$\Large {1/6}={1/10}+{1/s’}$
$\Large {1/s’}=({1/6}-{1/10})\:=({5/30}-{3/30})\:={2/30}\:={1/15}$
$\Large s’\:=\:15\:cm$

## Magnification

- Ratio of the image size to the object size
- Same as the negative of the ratio of the image distance to the object distance

> [!INFO]
> $\LARGE m\:=\:{h_i/h_o}\:=\:-{s’/s}$

- $m$ magnification
	- Positive:
	- Negative: 
- $h_i$ image size
- $h_o$ object size - are always positive
- $s’$ image distance
	- Positive: for real images
	- Negative: for virtual image
- $s$ object distance - are always positive

## Cues/Questions

### Question01: A piece of black tape is placed over the upper half of the lens. Which of the following is true?

![[457411B3-6B49-428A-B288-30AEB24C0FDC.jpeg]]

- [x] Only the lower half of the object (i.e. the arrow tail) will show on the screen
- [x] Only the upper half of the object (i.e. the arrow head) will show on the screen
- [ ] The whole object will still show on the screen

**Answer01**: The whole object will still show on the screen
