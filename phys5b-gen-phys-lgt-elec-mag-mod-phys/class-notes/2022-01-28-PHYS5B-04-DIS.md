W04.5 | Friday, January 28, 2022 | 12:05 PM

## Announcements

1. [[2022-02-07]] First real assignment isn't due until we are scheduled to return to campus
2. All assignments are open for 10 days before it is due

### Quick note

1. The "purpose" of this class
	1. Most of us aren't Physics majors
	2. This class is still very useful - I promise
	3. Maybe just not for the exact reasons you would expect
2. Thinking and working in three dimensions
	1. We're gonna do it
	2. Buckle up

## Notes

### Electron Response

1. Protons are massive compared to electrons
2. Electrons are the reason electric fields
3. Two possibilities of electrons that remain on an object that lost many of electrons
	1. Insulator
		1. They remain electrons stay put with their original atoms, and only the rubbed area has a net positive charge
	2. conductor
		1. The remaining electrons spread themselves out trying to fill up the electron clouds in the rubbed area
4. It is the distinction that determines whether an object is a conductor or insulator

### Electric Force

1. Newton's Third Law: For every force there exists an **EQUAL** and opposite force
	1. $\huge F_e\:=\:\frac{k\:\cdot \:q_1\cdot \:q_2}{r^2}$

## Cues/Questions

- Are the exams more like textbook or course lecture?
	- Exams are more like textbook
