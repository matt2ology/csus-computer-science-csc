# Chapter 24

W10.5 | Friday, March 11, 2022 | 11:59 AM

## Announcements

- Today wrap up lecture on chapter 24
	- Do a couple of sample problems
- Monday: ch 24 Group work
- Ch 24 Home work due Monday Night

## Notes

### Motion of Charges in B-Fields

- Three possible results
	- Parallel to field: straight line (no force)
	- Perpendicular to field: circles (centripetal force)
	- At some other angle to field: helix!
		- Constant velocity in one dimension circles in the other
	Charge is of constant speed $\Large \vec{F} = m\vec{a}$

### Motion in Circles

- Object moving in uniform circles with constant speed
	- Centripetal
	- $\LARGE a_c = {V^2}/r$ OR $\LARGE F_c = m v^2/r$
- But we just learned that $\Large F_b = qv\:\times\:B$
	- So $\LARGE qv\:\times\:B = m {v^2}/r$
		- ${{mv^2}/r} = quB$
		- ${{mv}/r} = qB$
		- $mv = rqB$
		- ${{mv}/{qB}} = r$

### Magnetic Field Equations

- A wire carrying current will create a magnetic field
- Use the right hand rule to determine what the field looks like
- Still need an equation to **calculate** the strength of the field
- From a long straight wire
	- $B_{line} = {Âµ_0I}/{2\pi r}$
	-
