# The Ray Model of Light

WW14.6 | Saturday, April 9, 2022 | 02:21 PM

 Basis of the ray model of light is an oversimplification of reality where light travels in straight lines. 
 
 The ray model of light ignores diffraction and is valid as long as the apertures are larger than $1\:mm$

In abstract a **light ray** is a line in the direction along which light energy is flowing.

The five basic ideas and assumptions of the ray model of light are:
1. Light rays are straight lines
	1. The speed of light in a material is $v={c/n}$, where $n$ is the index of refraction of the material
2. Light rays can cross
3. A light ray goes on forever unless it interacts with matter
	1. An interaction with matter that causes the ray to change direction or be absorbed and can happen in four different ways
		1. At an interface between two materials
		2. Is reflected
		3. Is refracted
		4. Or is both reflected and refracted
4. An object is a source of light rays
	1. Rays originate from every point on the object, and each point sends rays in all directions
	2. Objects are self-luminous or reflective
5. The eye sees by focusing a bundle of rays

## Sources of Light Rays

 In the ray model, there are two kinds of objects
 1. **Self-luminous objects**, or sources, directly create light rays
	 1. I.e. lightbulbs and the sun
 2. **Reflective objects** reflect rays originating in self-luminous objects
	 1. I.e. A sheet of paper or a tree

### Self-luminous objects

1. **A ray source** - a thin beam of a laser is a good approximation of a single ray
2. **A point source** - An idealized source of light where it is infinitely small and emits light rays in every direction. 
	1. I.e. Small Christmas lights
3. **An extended source** - The most common light source where the entire surface of an extended source is luminous, so that **every point of an extended source acts as a point source**
	1. I.e. lightbulbs, flames, and the sun
4. **A parallel-ray source** - Rays from a very distant object
	1. I.e. flashlights and movie projectors

## Ray Diagrams

WW14.6 | Saturday, April 9, 2022 | 03:10 PM

Rays originate from every point on an object and travel outward in all directions, so to simplify we use a **ray diagram** that shows only a few rays.

## Seeing Objects

Rays from an object must enter the eye for us to see an object

Everyone can see a point source or an extended source because a point source emits rays in every direction; in addition, since every point on the surface of an extended source is itself a point source, all parts of an extended source can be viewed by all observers.

Simple model of seeing can explain how we see nonluminous objects:
- **Diffuse reflection**: reflects incident light in every direction
	- Objects like paper, skin, glass, and etc. 
- **Scattering**: Single rays are broken into many weaker rays that leave in all directions

**Scattered light** is what allows you to read a book by lamplight for, every point on the surface of the page is struck by one or more ray from the lamp; then, because of **diffuse reflection** these rays scatter in every direction - some of the scattered rays reaches the eye.

You can make a laser beam visible by scattering it from very small particles (smoke, dust, mist of water) in air. Some of the scattered light rays reaches our eyes.

## Shadows

The simplest shadows are those cast by a point source of light. With a point source, the shadow is completely dark, and the edges of the shadow are sharp

However, shadows casted by extended sources are more complicated. An extended source is a collection of a large number of point sources, each of which cast its own shadow. The patters of shadow and light from each point overlap and so the shadow region is no longer sharp.
