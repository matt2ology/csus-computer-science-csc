# Optics

W14.1 | Monday, April 4, 2022 | 12:02 PM

## Announcements

- Today: more Optics
- Group work assignment Wednesday


## Plane, a flat, Mirror

 Creates an **upright** and **virtual image**

$\Huge s = s’$

## Thin Lenses

- Form an image by refraction
- Shape of lens and its refractive index determine its properties

### Thin Lens Properties
- Index of refraction
- Radius of curvature
	- Of each side
- **Focal length** (We care about)

## Convex Lens - Converging

Place where light merge is the focal point

The focal distance is the distance of lens to focal point

Fatter the lens the harder the math and harder to define a focal point

If you have an object too close to lens you’ll have an image that will be upright and virtual
- ie. a magnifying glass


## Concave Lens - Diverging

A concave, diverging, lens will always make virtual image.

## Ray Tracing Rules

- Light rays that intersect a thin lens at its center continue on a straight line
- Light rays that come in parallel to the axis (“Paraxial rays”) will:
	- Converging at the focal point of a converging lens
	- Diverging from the focal point of a diverging lens
- light rays coming along a line though the opposite focal point ($f’$) emerge parallel

## The Thin Lens Equation

Used to locate the image mathematically (free to use any measurement meters, millimeters, feet):
- $s$ = object distance
- $s’$ = image distance
- $f$ = focal length

${1/s}+{1/s’}={1/f}$

## Cues/Questions

## Summary

Highlight ==What's Important!==

When finished with each page, write a **2-3 sentence** summary of your notes at
the bottom of the page.
