# Chapter 25

W13.1 | Monday, March 28, 2022 | 11:54 AM

## Announcements

1. Wrap-up chapter 25 material, start sample problems
	1. After will start chapter 18, chapter 19, chapter 17
2. Chapter 25 Homework due [[2022-04-06]] night

## Applications of Faraday's Law $V=\frac{\Delta \Phi _B}{\Delta t}$

$\Huge V=\frac{\Delta \Phi _B}{\Delta t}$ same as $\Huge V=vBL$

- Electric Motors
- Electric Generators

## Lenz's Law - which direction the potential points

Induced magnetic field $\Huge I={V/R}$

1. Current is only induced when there is a change in magnetic flux though some surface
	1. **Magnetic Flux** mathematically is $\Large \Phi=BA$, conceptually is the number of magnetic field lines that punch through an area
		1. $B$ is the magnetic field
		2. $A$ is the area
2. The direction of the current is determined by charge
3. The induced current will create its own magnetic field that tries to undo the change

Finding magnetic Force: $\Large F_B=qUB$


### Application of Lenz's Law

- Traffic Lights
	- Car sensor in road
