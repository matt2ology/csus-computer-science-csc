## Announcements

[[2022-04-20]] Choose-your-own adventure exam review!

- [[2022-04-21]]: office Hours cancelled for Earth Week Planetarium Shows
- [[2022-04-22]]: Let's have a test on Chapters: 24, 25,18, 19, & 17
- [[2022-04-25]]: Return tests (maybe)

## Notes

$\LARGE F_B=qu\:B$
$\LARGE F_c=\frac{mv^2}{r}$

Combined

$\LARGE quB=\frac{mv^2}{r}$ 

REWRITEN

$\huge r=\frac{mv}{qB}$


## Cues/Questions

### The direction of the magnetic field in region 1 is:

![[IMG20220420120826.jpg]]

- [ ] Right
- [ ] Left
- [ ] Down
- [ ] Up
- [ ] Into the page
- [ ] Out of the page

> [!solution]
> The direction of the magnetic field in region 1 is **out of the page**
> The center of the quarter of the circle, in the region 1 left division of the box, so its magnetic force is stronger in the first box on the left in region 1

### A rectangular loop of wire carries a clockwise current. To the left of the loop is a long straight wire carrying a current down. which of the following statements about the loop is correct?

![[IMG20220420122739.jpg]]

- [ ] The loop has a net torque of zero and a net force of zero
- [ ] The loop has a net torque of zero, but a non-zero net force
- [ ] The loop has a non-zero net torque, but a net force of zero
- [ ] The loop has a non-zero net torque and a non-zero net force

> [!solution]
> The loop has a net torque of zero, but a non-zero net force

### Six simulations where three long straight parallel wires carry currents either into or out of the page. In each simulation, point $P$ is midway between two adjacent wires.

Rank the pictures from greatest to least on the basis of the magnetic field at point $P$

$\LARGE B_{line}=\frac{\mu _oI}{2\pi r}$

$\LARGE B_{line}\:\alpha =\frac{I}{r}$

Add the magnetic fields factoring the distance

> [!solution]
> **GREATEST** A, E, B, D, C = F **LEAST**


### Six identical rectangular wire loops are moving to the right at the same speed in the vicinity of a region with uniform magnetic fields. The strengths of the magnetic fields very indicated

![[IMG20220420124938.jpg]]

Rank the magnitude of the induced current in the loop at the instant shown

> [!solution]
> **GREATEST** A = D, B, F, C = E **LEAST**
