## Notes

Current is constant, only voltage change as it goes though a resistor; however, at a two way junction it becomes three currents $I_1$, $I_2$, $I_3$

```mermaid
graph LR
	current01[I_01] --> current02[I_02]
	current01 --> current03[I_03]
```

### Light bulbs

- Current must flow though

### Back to resistors: in series

- Resistors are connected in series when they are connected end-to-end with no junction between them
	- $R_{tot} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + ...$
- All current flows the same it's not "used up"
- The total voltage drop will be the sum of the individual drops

### Resistors in parallel 

- Resistors are connected in parallel when they are on separate branches that start and end at the same location
- In this case, the areas of the resistors effectively add, reducing the total resistance
	- $\LARGE R_{tot} = \left(\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}+\frac{1}{R_3}+\:...\right)^{-1}$
- Voltage is the same and the current is shared
