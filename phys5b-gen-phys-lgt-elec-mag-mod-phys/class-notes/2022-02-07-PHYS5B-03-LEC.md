# CH21 - Potential Energy

W06.1 | Monday, February 7, 2022 | 11:53 AM

## Announcements

- [[2022-02-07]] Our first assignment is due 
- [[2022-02-07]] We will dive into [[College physics a strategic approach by Field Knight Jones#Chapter 21 Electric Potential]]
- [[2022-02-11]] Will have our first group work assignment

## What we should know from Phys 5A

1. Moving mass to a higher position gives it more potential energy
	1. moving against the force of gravity
2. Moving mass to a lower position loses potential energy
	1. Moving with the force of gravity
3. We can use gravity to unleash energy

## Notes

### Electrical Potential Energy

1. Just as we have gravitational potential energy, we have electrical potential energy

### Reminder: The Sign of Work

1. Positive work: When the force is being exerted in the same direction as the motion
2. Negative work: When the force is exerted against the direction of motion

### Calculating Electric Potential Energy

We can use work to figure out potential energy

1. The [[Electric Force]] is a [[Conservative force]], like gravity
	1. The work done by the force is independent of path taken
2. When a charge is moved from one point to another, the charge in potential energy is equal to the work done
3. Well then let's move a charge and see how much work it takes
4. $\LARGE W\:=\:\int \:F\cdot dr\:=\:\int _{r_i}^{r_f}\:\left(\frac{kq_1q_2}{r^2}\right)\:\cdot \:dr\:=\:\left[-\frac{kq_1q_2}{r}\right]^{r_f}_{r_i}$
5. It's just three dimensional line integral though the appropriate space
6. Results: $U_{elec}=\frac{kq_1q_2}{r}$

### Electric Potential Energy Equation

1. So $U_{elec}=\frac{kq_1q_2}{r}$
	1. `r` is measured from the center of one object to another object
2. Where is electrical potential energy zero?
	1. At infinity!
	2. We will call this "far away" or "far apart" (act as if `r` is infinitely big that it is practically zero)

## Cues/Questions

- A point charge is released from rest in a region containing an electric field. The charge will start to move:
	- In a direction that makes it potential energy decrease
		- Objects undergoing spontaneous movement ALWAYS move to LOWER potential energy
- Which Case has the greater potential energy
	- Case B
