# More Optics

- Today: more Optics
- Chapter 18 HW due [[2022-04-11]]
- [[2022-04-20]] Exam 

## Practice Problem 01 - Magnification

- $f$ = 6 cm
- $s$ = 10 com
- $h_o$ = 3 cm
- FIND $s’$

**Solution**: Real image

> [!equation] The Thin Lens Equation
> $\Large {1/f}={1/s}+{1/s’}$

$\Large {1/6}={1/10}+{1/s’}$
$\Large {1/s’}=({1/6}-{1/10})$
$\Large {1/s’}\:=({5/30}-{3/30})$
$\Large {1/s’}\:={2/30}$
$\Large {1/s’}\:={1/15}$
$\Large ({1/s’})^{-1}\:=({1/15})^{-1}$
$\Large s’\:=\:15\:cm$

> [!info] Image Distance
> $\Large s’\:=\:15\:cm$

> [!INFO] Magnification Equation
> $\LARGE m\:=\:{h_i/h_o}\:=\:-{s’/s}$

$\LARGE m\:=\:{h_i/3}\:=\:-{15/10}$
$\LARGE m\:=\:{h_i/3}\:=\:-{1.5}$
$\LARGE m\:=\:{h_i/3}*3\:=\:-({1.5})*3$
$\LARGE m\:=\:{h_i}\:=\:-{4.5}$

## Spherical Mirrors

**Concave** - Mirror surface is on the inside of the curve
	- Also called **converging**
	- Can make a real, upside down, image
	- OR, right-side-up, virtual image

**Convex** - Mirror surface is on the outside of the curve
	- Also called **diverging**
	- Makes, upright, virtual images only

### Conventions

- Same equation as Lens Equation
- $s$ is always positive
- $s'$ is positive for real images
	- Same side of mirror as object
- $s'$ is negative for virtual images
	- Opposite side of mirror as the object
- $f$ is positive for a converging mirror
- $f$ is negative for a diverging
- 

## Summary - Lenses and Mirrors
- Converging lenses and mirrors can form real or virtual images
	- Concave mirror
	- Convex lens
	- Inside focal length -> virtual image
	- Outside focal length -> real image
- Diverging lenses and 

## Refractive Power

- The power of a lens is measured in **diopter** ($D$)
- This measures the ability of the lens to bend light
- Equals one over the focal length in meters
- This is your "prescription strength"
	- Notice: smaller focal length -> bends light **MORE** -> higher power

> [!Refractive Power Equation] Refractive Power Equation - must convert to meters before using
> $\Huge P\:=\:{1/f}$
> - $f$ Focal Length can be either positive or negative

## The Eye

Every human eye has two lens (we are all 4 eyes)
1. **Cornea**
	- Is fixed does not change size or focal length
1. **Lens**
	- Is able to adapt via the Ciliary muscle
	- The more closer an object is the more "power" your lens would need to focus on the object
		- The more bending of light is needed, so that the light may hit the Retina
