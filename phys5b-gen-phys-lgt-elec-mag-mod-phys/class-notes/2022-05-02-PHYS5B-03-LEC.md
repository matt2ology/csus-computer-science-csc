# General Relativity

WW18.1 | Monday, May 2, 2022 | 12:02 PM

## Announcement

- Final exam 20% new stuff: 10:15-12:15 Wednesday
	- Chapter 27, 28

-[[2022-05-02]] One last slide on Chapter 27 - Relativity
	- Then we will cover chapter 28: Quantum Physics (The Photoelectric Effect)
	- AND ONE TOPIC FROM CH 29: ATOPMS AND MOLECULES (THE BOHR MODEL OF HYDROGEN)
	- Then on to Ch 30: Nuclear Physics
- Ch 27 Home work posted and due [[2022-05-09]]
- Chapter 30 homework due [[2022-05-13]]

## Even more weirdness

“Gravitational Time Dilation” is an effect that causes time to slow down as you approach a massive object

## The Photoelectric Effect

A phenomenon where light (photo) can dislodge electrons (electric)

There is a relationship between the light being used and the resulting freed electrons

- Some lights will knock out electrons and some lights wont
	- Some lights are more powerful than others

[incomplete notes on this section]

## Measuring the Electrons

The color determines how fast they are going when they do get off; in addition, determine whether or not elections are knocked off at all

- Red light
	- No electrons
- Green light
	- Slow Electrons
- Blue light
	- Fast electrons

## Photon Energy

> [!tldr] Einstein’s Conclusion
> Light comes in little packets: $\LARGE E\:=\:hf$
> - Each packet has an amount of energy that depends on its frequency!

$\LARGE E\:=\:hf$
- $h$ = Planck’s Constant = $6.626 x 10^{-34}Js$
- $f$ = frequency (in Hz)

Electron Volt: $eV$
- $\LARGE eV\:\:=\:\frac{J}{C}$
	- $\LARGE (1.6x10^{-19}C)\:\frac{J}{C}\:=\:1.6x10^{-19}J$
