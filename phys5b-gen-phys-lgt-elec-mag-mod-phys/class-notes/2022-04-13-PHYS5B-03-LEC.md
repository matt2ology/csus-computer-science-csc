## Accommodation

All corrective lenses create virtual images

1. When the eye is focused far away the muscle is relaxed and the lens is thin
2. When the eye is focused on a close object the muscle contracts and the lens is more coved

## Defects

1. The normal **far point** is **infinity**
2. **Myopia - Nearsighted** = eye over converges, focusing the image in front of the retina
	1. Cannot focus on things that are far away
	2. Corrected with a diverging lens
3. The normal **near point** is 25 cm 
	1. ==Need to memorize== that the "**Normal near point is 25 cm**"
4. **Hyperopia - Farsighted** = eye under coverage, focusing the image behind retina
	1. Cannot focus on things nearby
	2. Corrected with a converging lens
