## Announcements

1. First "assignment" due [[2022-01-28]]
2. First real assignment isn't due until we are scheduled to return to campus [[2022-02-07|Monday, February 7th]]
	1. Homework assignments will be due Monday nights, giving both the weekend and Monday's class and Tutoring Center hours to complete them
3. Textbook reading: we are starting in Chapter 20
	1. We will likely start Chapter 21 [[2022-01-30]]
	2. We will be going backwards to cover chapters 17-19 later in the semester
		1. Won't even do those in sequential order either...

## Notes

### Gravity VS the Electric Force

#### Gravity

1. Gravity only acts on object with mass
2. Gravity is always an attractive force
	1. ![[Pasted image 20220126122647.png]]
3. Mass can only be positive

#### [[Electric Force]]

1. The electric force only acts on objects with charge
2. The electric force can be either attractive or repulsive
3. Electric charge can be either positive or negative

### Opposite attracts

1. Remember which direction the electric force will point == "opposite attract"
	1. Like charges repel

### [[Static Electricity]]

1. "Electricity" - Having to with electric charges
2. "Static" - Lacking movement, stationary
3. "Static Electricity" - Interactions of stationary electric charges
	1. Example: Static cling in clothing

### Time for Math

1. Like charges repel and opposite charges attract
	1. Bigger the charges, stronger the force
	2. Farther apart the charges, the weaker the force
	3. Equation for electric force
		1. ![[Pasted image 20220126123747.png]]
			1. Known as Coulomb's Law
2. Coulomb's Law
	1. The charges, $q _{1}$ and $q _{2}$, are given in the SI unit of charge, which are the coulomb
		1. 1 `C` is very large
		2. A single proton has a charge of only $1.60\:x\:10^{-19}$ C
		3. Charge of an electron is $-1.60\:x\:10^{-19}$ C
	2. The constant, k, is called the electrostatic constant, and is equal to 8.99 \* 10 \^9 N\*m\^2/C\^2

### Transferring Charge

1. Essentially every object, essentially, is "electrically neutral"
	1. Total charge is zero - neither positive or negative
	2. This does not mean that objects contain no charges

### Remember Atoms

1. A small dense nucleus that contains protons (and neutrons)
2. A cloud of electrons surrounding the nucleus
3. The nucleus is not going anywhere
	1. Too much mass (inertia), and the particles that make it up are BLANK_BLANK

#### Electrons: The Culprits of Static Electricity
