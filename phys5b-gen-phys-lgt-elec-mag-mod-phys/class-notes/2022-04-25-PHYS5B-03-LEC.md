# Relativity

W17.1 | Monday, April 25, 2022 | 12:15 PM

## Newtonian Relativity

- All velocity is relative

## Special Relativity

Everything you know is a lie...

- $\large F\:=\:ma$
- $\large K\:=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$
- $\large d\:=\:vt$

They are close approximations, but get inaccurate as one approach the speed of light

### Things change when you're FAST

The most important value in special relativity:

- The Lorentz Factor (the gamma factor): measures how much are the fundamental equations are wrong (i.e. $F\:=\:ma$)
- $\LARGE \gamma \:=\:\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta ^2}}$
- Where $\LARGE \beta \:=\:\frac{v}{c}$: The speed as a fraction of speed of light
	- $v$ is velocity
	- $c$ is the speed of light

| Object          | Speed (mph) | Speed (m/s) | $\LARGE \beta$ | $\LARGE \gamma$ |
| --------------- | ----------- | ----------- |:-------------- |:--------------- |
| Low Earth Orbit | 17100       | 7600.00     | 0.00002533333  | 1.000000000032  |
| Cosmic Muon |    670         |             |                |                 |

### How things change as you approach the speed of light

- $\LARGE t'\:=\:\gamma t$
	- "Time Dilation"
- $\LARGE l'\:=\:\frac{l}{\gamma}$
	- "Length Contraction"
- $KE\:=\:\left(\gamma \:-\:1\right)mc^2$
	- Approximately equal to $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ when $v << c$
