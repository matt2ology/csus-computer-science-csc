## Announcements

## Magnetic Flux

1. Uses a capital Phi ”$\Phi$”
2. If uniform filed and perpendicular $\Large \Phi_B = BA$
3. Conceptualized as “number of fields lines punching though some surface”
4. If the field isn’t perpendicular: $\Large \Phi = AB\cos \left(\theta \right)$

## Faraday’s Law

1. The induced potential is equal to the rate of the change of the magnetic flux
	1. $\Huge V=\frac{\Delta \Phi _B}{\Delta t}$ same as $\Huge V=vBL$
2. Possible ways to change magnetic flux:
	1. Change the size of the loop
	2. Change how much of the loop is in the field
	3. Change the strength of the field
	4. Change the angle of the loop to the field (most used)
