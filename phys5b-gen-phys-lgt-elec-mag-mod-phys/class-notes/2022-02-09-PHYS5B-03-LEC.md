## Notes

$\LARGE U_{elec}=\frac{Kq_1q_2}{r}$
1. Delta is always final - initial 
	1. $\Large \Delta \:\:U\:=U_{final}-U_{initial}$

### Electric Potential Energy of More Than Two Charges

- How do we deal with electrical potential energy of a system of more than two charges?
	- Our equations only allows for two charges
	- $\LARGE U_{elec}=\frac{Kq_1q_2}{r}$
- Deal with the system in pairs!
	- There are 3 pairs in a 3 point system
	- There are 6 pairs in a 4 point system

### Introducing the Electric Potential

- Coulomb's Law to determine force, we introduced the electric field
	- A tool to make calculations of force easier
- Now that we have an equation to calculate potential energy, we introduce a similar tool: the electric potential
- Just as the electric field can tell you what the force will be on a charge at some point, the electric potential can tell you what the potential energy of a charge will be at some point

## Cues/Questions

Two Charges, equal in magnitude but opposite sign, are placed at equal distances from point A as shown. If a third charge is added to the system place at point A, how does the electric potential energy of the charge collection change? 
- Potential energy does not change; for, energy is a scalar (energy does not have direction)
	- Notice that electrical potential energy can still be negative though

Two point charges are separated by some distance as shown. The charge of the first positive. The charge of the second is negative and its magnitude is twice as large as the first. Is it possible to find a place to bring a third charge in from infinity without changing the total potential energy of the system?
- YES, no matter what the sign of the third charge
	- This is essentially identical to our earlier discussion of finding a place where the force would be zero. The charges have different strengths, so the point won't be exactly half way in between, but will be closer to the weaker charge.
