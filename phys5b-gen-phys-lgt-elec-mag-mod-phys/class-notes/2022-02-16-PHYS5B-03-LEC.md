## Notes

Speed of light $\large c\:=\:3\:*\:10^8\frac{m}{s}$ = 300,000,000 $\large \frac{m}{s}$


### The Field-Potential Connection

- Coulmbs Law: $\LARGE F=\frac{kq_1q_2}{r}$
	- $F$: Force
- $\LARGE E\:=\frac{kq}{r^2}$
	- $E$: Electric Field
- $\LARGE U=\frac{kq_1q_2}{r}$
	- $U$:
- $\LARGE V=\frac{kq}{r}$
	- $V$:

### Calculating Potential From Field

- The change in potential is the integrated electric field you traverse in moving from point A to point B
- If the electric field is uniform, unchanging, in this trip, then the equation is easy
	- $\large \Delta V=E\cdot d$
		- $\Delta V=V$ just as $\large U_g=mgh$
		- Velocity is relitive to [Compared object]
		
### Getting Back To The Start

- The electric force is conservative
	- Path doesn't matter
	- The $\Delta V$ along path 1-a-b-c-2 is the same as along 1-d-2
		- $\Delta (DELTA)$ **is always** $V_{Final} - V_{Initial}$

### Electric Field and Potenial

- $\large \Delta V=E\cdot d$
- Change in potential is equal to the product of the electric field and the distance
- **Warning**: Like forces and distance in the equation for work - the anser depends on the two vectors align.

### New Electric Field Units

- Units of electic field: $\frac {N}{C}$
- Multiply by $\frac {m}{m}$: $\frac {N m}{N m}$
- But ${N m}$ is joules
- So we have: $\frac {J}{C m}$ or  

### Conductor

- Charges free to move
- If there was an electric field inside a conductor, the charges would move
	- Until they cancle out
- $E=o$ in a conductor!
- The whole conductor is an equipotential
- $E$ at surface perpendicular to surface

## Cues/Questions

- Suppose the electric field is zero in a certain region of space. Which of the following statements best describes the electric potential in this region?

	- [x] The electric potential is zero everywhere in this region 
	- [x] The electric potential is zero at at least one point in this region
	- [ ] The electric potential is
	- [x] There is not enough information given to distinguished which of the above answers is correct
