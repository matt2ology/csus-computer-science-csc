## Evidence for SR: Cosmic Muons

The muon ($\large \mu$) is an unstable particle crated in the Earth's upper atmosphere when cosmic rays collide with gas molecules.

$\LARGE t'\:=\:\gamma\:t$

## Interstellar Travel

- The nearest star is several light years away
- The nearest habitable planet might be 100 light years away
- The other side of the galaxy is almost 100,000 light years away

## Some Math: Trip to Alpha Centauri

Does it matter if we travel at 99% the speed of light or 99.99% the speed of light?
- Doesn't really matter to the people on Earth:
- $d\:=\:vt\:\rightarrow \:t\:=\:\frac{d}{v}$
	- 4.37 ly / 0.99 c = 4.41 years or 1612 days
	- 4.37 ly / 0.9999 c = 4.37 years or 1596 days
- BUT it matters a lot to people on board!
- $\LARGE \gamma \:=\:\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta ^2}}$
