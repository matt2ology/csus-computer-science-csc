# The Hydrogen Atom

W18.3 | Wednesday, May 4, 2022 | 11:59 AM

## For Lab: The Hydrogen Atom

- A hydrogen atom is composed of one electron orbiting one photon
- The electron cannot orbit at just any distance
	- It is restricted to certain discrete energy levels

### Quantum Leaps

- Quantum Leap does not mean a huge jump forward
- Technically it just means a discrete leap
	- A very tiny leap…

$n$ principle quantum number

$\LARGE U_E=\frac{kq_1q_2}{r}$

## Terms to Know

- Atomic Number ($Z$)
	- Equal to the number of protons in the atom
	- Tells you which element you are dealing with
- Atomic Mass ($A$)
	- Equal to number of protons PLUS the number of neutrons in the atom
	- Does not affect chemistry
	- Will affect radioactivity

## Isotopes: Same Element, Different Mass

- Different “versions” of the same element
	- They have the same number of protons
- The number of neutrons can be different though
- Carbon dating relies on the fact that carbon has more than one isotope
	- Carbon 12 is “normal” stable isotope of carbon
	- Carbon 14 is radioactive, but is all around us
