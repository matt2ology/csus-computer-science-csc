# Light

W13.5 | Friday, April 1, 2022 | 12:08 PM

## Total Internal Reflection

Incident angle greater than critical angle youâ€™d get total internal reflection

### Underwater in Swimming Pools

- Can total internal reflection prevent the person from seeing light?
	- No, There will always be a ray that can be be drawn from the light that goes to the person

## Real Image VS. Virtual Images

### Real Image

- Formed by the convergence of light rays at location
	- Light rays arrive at location
- Can be displayed

### Virtual Image - Magnifiers, telescopes, mirrors, binoculars

- Formed by diverging rays that appear to came from a location
- No light rays actually go to the location of a virtual image
- Image only appears to be located from some location
