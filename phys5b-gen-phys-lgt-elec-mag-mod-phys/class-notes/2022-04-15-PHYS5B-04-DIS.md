## Announcements

## For Nearsighted ==Unfinished section notes==

## Lenses in Combination

> [!info] Analysis of multi-lens systems requires only one new rule
> The image of the first lens acts as the object for the second lens

## Double Lens Example ==Unfinished section notes==


## The Microscope ==Unfinished section notes==

The magnification is the product of the lens set

## The Telescope

Increases the angular size of an object

> [!note]
> $\LARGE M\:=\:\frac{\theta _{eye}}{\theta _{obj}}\:=\:-\frac{f_{obj}}{f_{eye}}$

## Cues/Questions

### Example02: Ellen wears eyeglasses with the prescription $-1.5D$. What eye condition does Ellen have?

> [!solution]
> Myopia - Nearsighted

#### What is her far point without glasses?

> [!hint] $\LARGE \infty$ is always the far-point for those with myopia - Nearsighted
> $\LARGE \frac{1}{s}+\frac{1}{s'}=\frac{1}{f}$
> 
> $\LARGE \frac{1}{\infty \:\:m}+\frac{1}{s'}=\frac{1}{f}$
> 
> $\LARGE s'=f=-0.67\:m$

> [!solution]
> $\huge f\:=\:\frac{1}{P}\:=\:\frac{1}{-1.5D}\:=\:-0.67m$

## Summary

When finished with each page, write a **2-3 sentence** summary of your notes at
the bottom of the page.

# Chapter 17: Wave Optics

## Why is the sky blue?

Scattering!

Two types of scattering
1. Reflection
1. Atomic level scattering (Rayleigh Scattering)

### Rayleigh Scattering

- Depends on wavelength, much like dispersion
- Smaller wavelength are more easily scattered
- Blue light from the sun gets scattered around the sky
- Red light from the sun gets to take a direct path to your eye

### What About Sunsets?

Sunsets appear red because all of the blue has been scattered out leaving only red
