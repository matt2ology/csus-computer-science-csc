W06.5 | Friday, February 11, 2022 | 12:02 PM

## Announcements

1. Convocation is next Monday 

## Equations So Far

1. $F=\frac{kq_1q_2}{r^2}$
2. $F=qE$
3. $U=\frac{kq_1q_2}{r}$
4. $U=qV$
	1. $U$: Potential Energy
	2. $V$ Potential

## Notes

### Introducing the Electric Potential

### Potential, Electric Potential

- We use $V$ to denote the electric potential
	- $U=qV$
- The units are joules/coulomb, which we will give it's own name:
	- volts (also $V$)
- The electric potential is often referred to simply as "The Potential"

## Cues/Questions

- What are the units for the electric field?
	- [x] newtons/coulombs
- What are the units for the electric potential?
	- [x]  joules/coulomb
- Is "the potential" a vector or a scalar?
	- [x] Scalar: a number without direction
