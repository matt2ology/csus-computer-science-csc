# Wave Optics

## Announcements

- Midterm part 2 [[2022-04-22]]

![[2022-04-15-PHYS5B-04-DIS#Why is the sky blue]]

A light's wavelength is measured from it's peak to the next peak

**ROY G BIV**: ($\huge \lambda$, $E$) Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet ($\lambda$, $\huge E$)

- The cooler color spectrum is more likely to scatter
- **Cooler** color light spectrum have a **shorter wave length**, but has **more energy**
- **Warmer** color light spectrum have a **longer wave length**, but has **less energy**

## Colors via Absorption

Objects absorbs it's own color

A red stain glass window, filters out all colors but red, allows only red color to pass though

## Constructive Interference

Two crest waves comes together it's amplitude increases

## Destructive Interference

One trough and one crest wave "cancels" out each other.

## Interference

### Diffraction

The bending of light when the wave fronts are limited

## Young's Double Slit Experiment

$\sin \left(\theta \right)\:=\:\frac{opp}{hyp}\:=\:\frac{\Delta x}{d}$

becomes...

$d\sin \left(\theta \right) = \Delta x$
