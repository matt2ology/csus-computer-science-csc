# The Lorentz Force (the magnetic fields)

W10.3 | Wednesday, March 9, 2022 | 12:07 PM

## Announcements

1. Exam 1 grading completed
	1. Exam raw class average: 51.1%
	2. Top score: 96% (raw)
		1. 2 students scored a 90 or higher before the curve, 8 after
	3. No surprise to me, Workout 3 had the lowest average
		1. Vectors!
	4. Today: Continue chapter 24: Magnetic Fields and Forces
		1. You did watch the video, right?

## Notes

### The Lorentz Force

1. $\Large F=\:qv\:x\:B$ O-> $\Large \left|F\right|=qvBsin\theta$
	1. $x$ is the `vector cross product` and read as "cross"
2. A charge particle crossing magnetic fields lines will feel a force
3. It's just an act of nature
4. Technically, this is only half of what physicists call "The Lorentz Force"
	1. This is "The Magnetic Force"
	2. Combine it with "The Electric Force" ($F = qE$) to get the Lorentz Force: $F = qE + (F=\:qv\:x\:B)$

### The Right Hand Rule: Forces

1. "Old-school" way
	1. Use thumb, index finger, and middle finger to represent $v$, $B$, and $F$
2. Moving fingers way
	1. Point your fingers with $v$ (velocity), curl them towards $B$ (magnetic field), thumb is $F$ (force)
3. My Favorite Way
	1. Use a flat hand
	2. Thumb is velocity (only one thumb, only one velocity)
	3. Fingers are magnetic field (many fingers, many field lines)
	4. Open palm is the force (SMACK!)
4. **All of these will work for positive charges**
