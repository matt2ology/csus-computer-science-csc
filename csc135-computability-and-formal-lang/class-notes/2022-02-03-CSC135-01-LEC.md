# Python Classes

W05.4 | Thursday, February 3, 2022 | 09:02 AM

## Notes

1. Our course will be mostly data structures

## Point Class in Java

```Java
// Point.java
public class Point{
	// Start with fields and they tend to be private
	private double x;
	private double y;

	// then have a constructor and one would have additional
	// ones with more specificity 
	public Point(double x, double y){
		// This reference the x in the object the class variable
		// not the argument variable
		this.x = x;
		this.y = y;
	}

	// Second constructor where no (x, y) were provided
	// making the point at the origin
	public Point(){
		this.x = 0;
		this.y = 0;
	}

	// Good idea to write a toString
	public String toString(){
		// the x below refers to the one in most closest in scope,
		// so it's the one in the object (the class varible)
		return "(x=" + x + ", y=" + y + ")";
	}

	public double distance(Point other){
		// Can use the pothag theorem
		double dx = this.x - other.x;
		double dy = this.y - other.y;
		return Math.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy);
	}
}
```

## Point Class in Python

You'll notice that you don't have to provide a type for a variable; for, Python is a dynamically typed language.

In Python there isn't any "access control" for it was a system program; where as, Java is built with security in mind.

Python uses an explicate "this" in contrast to Java's implicate implementation

Python doesn't allow a second constructor nor does it have function/method overloading, so one may utilize default values.

In Java the variables will be automatically promoted 

> `"(x=" + self.x + ", y=" + self.y + ")";`
>> Can only concatenate str (not "float") to str

So you have to do 

> `"(x=" + str(self.x) + ", y=" + str(self.y) + ")";`

```Python
# point.py
import math

# can import particular functions from a lib/class
# from math import sqrt

class Point:
	# all constructors are called __init__
	# Python has an explicite "this" parameter
	# Python doesn't allow a second constructor nor does it have
	# function/method overloading, so one may utilize default values.
	def __init__(self, x=0.0, y=0.0):
		self.x = x
		self.y = y

	# Java toString equv.
	def __str__(self):
		return "(x=" + str(self.x) + ", y=" + str(self.y) + ")";

	def distance(self, other):
		dx = self.x - other.x
		dy = self.y - other.y
		return math.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy)

point_01 = Point(3.0,0.0)
point_02 = Point()

point_03 = Point(0.0,3.0)
point_04 = Point(4.0,0.0)
print(p1.distance(p2))
```

## CodeStepByStep Python Class For Rectangle

```python
class Rectangle:
	def __init__(self, x, y, w, h):
		self._x = x
		self._y = y
		self._width = w
		self._height = h
		if w < 0 or h < 0:
			raise ValueError()

	def __str__(self):
		return "Rectangle [x=" + str(self._x) + \
			", y=" + str(self._y) + ", width=" + \
			str(self._width) + ", height=" + \
			str(self._height) + "]"

	@property
	def x(self):
		return self._x

	@property
	def y(self):
		return self._y

	@property
	def width(self):
		return self._width

	@property
	def height(self):
		return self._height
```
