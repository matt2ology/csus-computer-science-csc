# 2022-01-27T1035-CSC135 - Optional Q&A

WW04.4 | Thursday, January 27, 2022 | 10:36 AM

1. Python problem on Mimir has not yet been posted as of [01/27/2022]
	1. For now 10-20 Python exercises from Code Step By Step. Do at least two from each of the sections collections/list, collections/dict, collections/set, loops, parameters and return
	2. Among the 10-20 exercise you do, include the following
		1. [https://www.codestepbystep.com/problem/view/python/parameters/count_digits](https://www.codestepbystep.com/problem/view/python/parameters/count_digits)
		2. [https://www.codestepbystep.com/problem/view/python/collections/set/num_in_common](https://www.codestepbystep.com/problem/view/python/collections/set/num_in_common)
		3. [https://www.codestepbystep.com/problem/view/python/collections/list/collapse](https://www.codestepbystep.com/problem/view/python/collections/list/collapse)
		4. [https://www.codestepbystep.com/problem/view/python/collections/dict/has_duplicate_value](https://www.codestepbystep.com/problem/view/python/collections/dict/has_duplicate_value)
2. What is this class like?
	1. CSC 135 is combination of Computer theory and programming language, so to condense courses required
		1. Previously the course was taught with Racket, but now use Python as the means to learn Functional programming topics
	2. May feel like CSC 130'
		1. Feel more algorithmic and more relevant
	3. Fair amount of programming
		1. Data structures
	4. Ted Krovetz would appreciate course feedback on evaluations
		1. Is the course relevant?
		2. What did you wish you had learned?
3. Will you check prerequisites?
	1. No.  The college should have done all that pre-work.
4. If I am interested more in the theory than applications is there anything big we'd end up skipping or covering less heavily with the new format?
	1. No this will not be theory heavy
	2. Ghassan Shobaki's CSC 135 is taught more heavy (similar to older CSC 132 course)
5. Do we have to do the Udacity course if we are already have a working knowledge of Python?
	1. No, but be sure to do the assignments
