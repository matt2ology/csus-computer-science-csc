# Graded Homework

WW04.3 | Wednesday, January 26, 2022 | 06:15 PM

## Python Homework

 1. May collaborate with one or two other students on this homework if you wish
 2. Collaboration: Work put into each problem should be roughly equal and all parties should come away understanding the solution
	 1. **Pair programming** - Problems solved this way can be individually submitted
		 1. Two or three look at the screen - while one of the members operate the keyboard. 
		 2. The one operating the keyboard is the "driver" and the other is the "navigator".
			 1. The driver explains talks through their code
			 2. The navigator asks questions and make suggestions.
				 1. Tutors the driver to help them understand the solution if driver is "stuck"
		 3. The driver and navigator should switch roles every 10 to 15 minutes.
	 2. **Code review**
		 1. Members of the collaborative each try to solve the problem independently
		 2. Each member take turn analyzing each other's code
			 1. Ask questions to understand each other's algorithm
			 2. Suggesting improvements
		 3. After code reviews - each collaborator can then fix their own code
			 1. Do not copy code
			 2. Recreate your own variant without looking at your partner's
 3. Goal is to learn from one another, so you can write similar code on your own during exam
 4. Find collaborators via Discord and/or use group-finding post on Piazza

## Homework Exercises

Tasks are due by Midnight [[2022-02-06|Sunday, February 6]] (1% of grade)

1. Do 10-20 Python exercises from Code Step By Step
	1. Do at least two from each of the sections
		1. collections/list
		2. collections/dict
		3. collections/set
		4. loops
		5. parameters and return
	2. Among the 10-20 exercise you do, include the following
		1. [codestepbystep problem python > parameters > count_digits](https://www.codestepbystep.com/problem/view/python/parameters/count_digits)
			1. [[CodeStepByStep Python Parameters count_digits]]
		2. [codestepbystep problem python > collections > set > num_in_common](https://www.codestepbystep.com/problem/view/python/collections/set/num_in_common)
		3. [codestepbystep problem python > collections > list > collapse](https://www.codestepbystep.com/problem/view/python/collections/list/collapse)
		4. [codestepbystep problem python > collections > dict > has_duplicate_value](https://www.codestepbystep.com/problem/view/python/collections/dict/has_duplicate_value)
2. On our programming exam, you will be asked to bring a laptop to class and use the Mimir web programming interface to edit and submit small Python programs
	1. Will soon put a Python problem on Mimir to practice
	2. Go to Mimir and practice editing and submitting a Python solution there
	3. A tester will tell you whether your code passes my test cases
	4. Do not need to click the submission button
		1. Whatever code was the last one you ran the tester on is the version that will ultimately get graded
