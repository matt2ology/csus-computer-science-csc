# Tail Recursion Optimization

W08.4 | Thursday, February 24, 2022 | 08:57 AM

## Agenda

1. Traversing HAMT
2. Tail recursion
3. Code Step-by-step

## Traversing HAMT - Logic

```text
visit(self):
	# Do something here (before visiting children)
	for i = 0 to deg-1
		if child[i] not None:
			visit(child[i])
	# Do something here (after visiting children)
```

## Tail recursion

- Recursion may break one's stack frame: O(n) or worse
- **Tail call optimization**: If the last operation is a recursive call, the recursion can be turned into a loop.

```python
def foo(x):
	if x is small:
		# solve directly
	else:
		# ...
		foo(smaller_x) # very last work done in branch of recursive function
```

The sample pseudo-code is effectively the same as the loop-based approach below

```python
def foo(x):
	while True:
		if x is small:
			# solve directly
			return
		else:
			# ...
			x = smaller x
```

Java nor Python will optimize your code; however, GCC, a **C** compiler, will do it for you

### Greatest Common Divisor `gcd(x,y)` - Euclid's Algorithm

Pseudo-code recursion approach

```python
def gcd(x,y):
	if y == 0:
		return x
	else:
		return gcd(y, x % y)
```

Pseudo-code loop-based approach

- Avoid a stack call overhead

```python
def gcd(x,y):
	while True:
		if y == 0:
			return x
		else:
			(x,y) = (y, x & y)
```

### Factorials

Can't be turned into a loop

```python
def fact(x):
	if x == 0:
		return 1
	else:
		return x \* fact(x-1)
```

You can get around this via an **accumulator** where it works out the solution as you go down, before the call, and NOT provide a result after the call

#### Factorials - Accumulator Version

```python
def fact(x, accu):
	if x == 0:
		return accu
	else:
		return fact(x-1, accu \* x)
```

#### Factorials - Loop Version of Accumulator Version

```python
def fact(x, accu = 1):
	while True:
		if x == 0:
			return accu
		else:
			(x, accu) = (x-1, x \* accu)
```

## Another Example - Rewrite the following function to use-tail recursion

```python
# Multiplies a and non-negative b using repeated addition
def mult(a, b):  
    if b == 0:  
        return 0  
    else:  
        return a + mult(a, b-1)
```

### Tail Recursion

```python
# Multiplies a and non-negative b using repeated addition
def mult(a, b, acc = 0):
    if b == 0:
        return acc
    else:
        return mult(a, b-1, a + acc)
```

## Cues/Questions

- O(n) stack frames problem for HAMT
	- Test cases professor uses won't blow-up the stack counter
	- Nevertheless, best to implement a loop-based solution
