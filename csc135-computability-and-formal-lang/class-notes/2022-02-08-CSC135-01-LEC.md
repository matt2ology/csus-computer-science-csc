# Functional Programming

W06.2 | Tuesday, February 8, 2022 | 09:01 AM

## Notes

1. 1900s key figures
2. Both started thinking
	1. What is computational
	2. How can machines compute
		1. [[Alonzo Church]]
			1. Developed Lambda Calculus
				1. Computational as Mathematical Functions
		2. [[Alan Turing]]
			1. Invented the Turing Machine
				1. An algorithm as "loop-base"
4. Functional Computation/Languages
	1. Reduce bugs
	2. Immutable states/variables
	3. Models computation as evaluation of mathematical functions
	4. No mutation (variables never change)
	5. No global state; as a result, no side-effect in a function
	6. No Loops, so there is rich library to do loop-like things and recursion for the rest
5. Two First Functional Language
	1. Fortran - Loops, ect.
	2. Lisp - Functional

## Legacy

1. Higher Order Functions
	1. Is a function that can another function as parameters
2. Lambda Function
	1. An anonymous function: a function without name (Foo, Bar)
3. Library functions that take function parameters
4. Constructions that do loop-like things
	1. For example in Java the "for-each": `for(in s: list){ <code> }`
	2. Versus the mutable version of the for-loop `for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++`
5. Immutable data structure

## Higher Order Functions

Because it's a dynamic language it's up the the caller to determine which function is called

```python
# f is the name of the function
# x is the int we want as base
# n is the number of times
# Example multi(f, 1, 4)
# >> f(f(f(1)))
def multi(f):
	acc = x
	for i in range(n):
		acc = f(acc)
	return acc
```

If we wanted to add one... We'll need to make a function that does so

```python
def add_1(x):
	return x+1

multi(add1(1), 0, 10)
# >> 10
```

## Lambda Function:

Lambdas in Python are restrictive and doesn't allow multiple lines

It's useful when you need a "one-off" function; however, if you need to use that function multiple times the normal function creation, `def function_name()`, would be optimal

```python
# if we want add_1 as a lambda
lambda x: x + 1
```

So instead of doing
```python
multi(add1(1), 0, 10)
```

You can do this instead

```python
multi(lambda x: x + 1, 0, 10)
```

## Higher Order Library Functions (library functions that take functions)

```python
sort(list)

# The functional version
# Takes the old list and creates a new list

list_02 = sorted(list)

# Python has a feature where one may name the paramters
# Key is a named paramter and f is a function where it returns an int.
# Items sorted based on int

list_03 = sorted(list, key = f)

int_array = [1, 2, 3, 4] # we want this to become [2, 4, 1, 3]
int_array_02 = sorted(int_array, key = lambda x: x % 2)
```

### Map

Maps takes an object and returns an object

we want this

	integer_list = [1, 2, 3]
	map(f,l) -> [f(1), f(2), f(3)]

```python
def myMap(f, l):
	new_list = [ ]
	for element in l:
		new_list.append(f(x))
	return new_list
```

if we want the have the returned value to function as a list: `list(map(f, l))`

### Filter

Filter takes an object (anything) and returns a Boolean

list = [1, 2, 3, 4]

filter(f, l) -> [list of elements making f True]

```python
filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, the_list)
```

The loop version of filter

```python
def myFilter(f, the_list):
	new_list = [ ]
	for x in list:
		if f(x):
			new_list.append(x)
	return new_list
```

### Reduce

Reduce is a method to take a list and "summarize" it

Is called like so `reduce(f, the_list)`

For example
```python
the_list = [1, 2, 3]
reduce(lambda x,y: x+y, the_list) 
# Produces 6
# Because 1 + 2 = 3 and then we have the last elment (3)
# 3 + 3 = 6
```

If we were to create this via a loop

```python
def myReduce(f, the_list)
	acc = None
	for x in the_list:
		if acc == None:
			acc = x
		else:
			acc = f(acc, x)
	return acc
```

### List Comprehension

#### The Syntax

```python
newlist = [_expression_ for _item_ in _iterable_ if _condition_ == True]
```

```python
list01 = [1,2,3]
list02 = [2*x for x in list] # produces [2,4,6]
# {x x E and x mod 2 == 0}
```
