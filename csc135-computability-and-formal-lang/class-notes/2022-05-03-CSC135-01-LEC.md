# Turing Machine - A control unit with two stacks

W18.2 | Tuesday, May 3, 2022 | 09:05 AM

Computers were mechanical at the time. Tape was its media of memory.

- Is deterministic
	- No $\LARGE \lambda$ transitions
	- No multiple arrows (no choice between multiple paths)
- The machine `HALTS` when no arrow out for current configuration
- No `ACCEPT STATES` - has Input/Output only

## Turing Machine Example 01

> [!Example] Toggle binary input string

> [!solution] pseudocode 
> ```text
> While head over symbol
> 	Toggle symbol
> 	Move R
> Move L
> While head over symbol
> 	Move L
> Move R

To be a while loop one must be able to leave a state and come back to it

### Text Description

A turing machine is a collection of four tuples

($\LARGE q_0, B, L, q_1$)
($\LARGE q_0, 0, 1, q_3$)
($\LARGE q_0, 1, 0, q_3$)

### CONFIGURATION

[$\LARGE q_0, B, L, q_1$]
 
\<$Our State, under head, left, right$\>
- $underhead$: Single symbol or $B$ (BLANK)
- $left, right$ are strings or $\large \lambda$ if none

### Trace Computation

$\LARGE <q_0, 0,\:\lambda, 10>\:\vdash\:<q_3, 1, \lambda, 10>\:\vdash\:<q_0, 1, 1, 0>$
