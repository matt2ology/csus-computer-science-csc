#### Python Homework

You may collaborate with _one or two_ other students on this homework if you wish, or work alone. Collaboration must be true collaboration however, which means that the work put into each problem should be roughly equal and all parties should come away understanding the solution. Here are some suggested ways of collaborating.

-   Pair programming. Two or three of you look at the same screen and only one of you operate the keyboard. The one at the keyboard is the "driver" and the other is the "navigator". The driver explains everything they are doing as they do it and the navigator asks questions and makes suggestions. If the navigator knows how to solve the problem and the driver does not, the navigator should not dictate solutions to the driver but instead should tutor the driver to help them understand. The driver and navigator should switch roles every 10-15 minutes. Problems solved this way can then be individually submitted.
-   Code review. The members of the collaborative each try to solve the problem independently. They then take turns analyzing each other's code, asking questions trying to understand each other's algorithms and suggesting improvements. After the code reviews, each of you can then fix your code using what you learned from the reviews. Do not copy code. If the result of code review is that your code needs changes to be more like your partner's, do not copy it. Instead recreate your own variant without looking at your partner's.

The goal is to learn enough from one another so that you each can write similar code independently in an exam situation.

If you want a collaborator but don't know people in the class, you can ask on Discord and/or use the group-finding post on Piazza.

**Homework Exercises**

Completion of these tasks by Midnight February 6 is worth approximately 1% of your course grade. No late homework will be accepted.

1.  Do 10-20 Python exercises from Code Step By Step. Do at least two from each of the sections collections/list, collections/dict, collections/set, loops, parameters and return. Challenge yourself by picking non-trivial exercises.
    
    Among the 10-20 exercise you do, include the following

2.  On our programming exam, you will be asked to bring a laptop to class and use the Mimir web programming interface to edit and submit small Python programs. To practice this process, I will soon put a Python problem on Mimir. You should go to Mimir and practice editing and submitting a Python solution there. Each time you run your code, a tester will tell you whether your code passes my test cases. If you click on the test case, it may give you more information about syntax or runtime errors.
    
    NOTE: you do not need to click the submission button. Whatever code was the last one you ran the tester on is the version that will ultimately get graded.
