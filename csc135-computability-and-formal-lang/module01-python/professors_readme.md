### Python in CSC 135

Python is one of the more important programming languages. In fact, if you search the internet for "programming language ranking" you will easily find lots of articles listing it in the top few. The reasons are many. Here are just a few.

1.  It is easy to learn. The core Python language is pretty small and clean. You can learn the basics quickly.
2.  It's a dynamically typed and interpreted language. This means you don't declare variable types and you don't compile code before running it, which means small programs are faster to write and execute.
3.  Libraries! Many powerful libraries have been developed for Python, making it the most popular way to get work done in many domains.

**Learning Python**

Since Python is not a prerequisite for this course, we will spend the first two weeks learning it. We will not go deep, but we will learn enough to write small programs and classes.

You will first work through the first five lessons of Udacity's free Python class ([https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110)). This should take you ten hours plus or minus a few hours. Because you are an experienced programmer, you will not be learning many new concepts, but instead will be learning syntax for concepts you already know.

Next, you will practice your new skill at [https://www.codestepbystep.com/](https://www.codestepbystep.com/) on a handful of exercises at about the difficulty of CSC 20. You will turn in some problems for credit at [https://mimirhq.com/](https://mimirhq.com/)

**Installing Python**

If you don't already have a Python IDE, I recommend using the Thonny IDE. It's designed for beginners and is simple and self-contained. It is the IDE I'll be using for demonstartion purposes.

**Use of Python in this class**

One of the topics of this class is functional programming. Traditionally this means the use of a language like Scheme, Racket or Haskell, but I'm going to take a different approach. I want those who have not been introduced to Python to learn the basics of Python, but also we will use Python to explore what it means to program in a functional style. This primarily means:

1.  Data structures are designed to be mutation-free. This means that once an object is created it cannot be changed (eg, String in Java).
2.  Functions and methods have no side effects. This means functions and methods should not change any variables outside the function or method's scope. The result of a function should simply be its return value.
3.  Use of higher-order functions and lambda functions. Functions can be passed as
