#### Python Homework Setup

1. Find your name in the following list. In both Code Step By Step and Mimir, use exactly the same first and last name found in the list (including lower/upper case). This will allow me to match your work for credit on Canvas.

2. Get a free account at [https://codestepbystep.com](https://codestepbystep.com/). Under "My Account" connect it with the school "California State University Sacramento" (no comma!). Under "My Courses" add our course. This will allow me to monitor your progress.

3. Get a free account at Mimir and connect it to our class by following the link [https://class.mimir.io/courses/c9628eb685/registrations/new](https://class.mimir.io/courses/c9628eb685/registrations/new). Graded programs will be submitted via Mimir and programming exams will use its programming interface.
