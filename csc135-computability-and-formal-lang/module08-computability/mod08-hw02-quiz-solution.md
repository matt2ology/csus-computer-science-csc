## Question 1

A Turing machine that deletes all initial 1 characters from the beginning of the input and leaves the head over the next character can be written with just two states and two transitions. Here's a few examples of its behavior.

    Before   After
    1100     00     // Delete any initial 1s; head at first non-1
    ^        ^
    00       00     // Delete any initial 1s; head at first non-1
    ^        ^
    B        B      // Delete any initial 1s; head at first non-1
    ^        ^

Fill in the blanks to make a TM that achieves this task.

## Question 2

Below is a Turing machine that consumes a palindrome made of 0s and 1s and leaves the tape blank. For example, on the following inputs, the output is a blank tape.

![Turing Machine example](mod08-images/2021-05-11-0001.jpg)

If the input to this machine is 0110, what state does the machine end in? (Answer as a single digit integer.)

If the input to this machine is 010, what state does the machine end in? (Answer as a single digit integer.)

If you wanted to output a 1 in the case that the input was an even length palindrome, you could achieve that be adding one more transition arrow (pointing to a new state 9). Specify the transition: [ ], [ ], [ ], q9.

## Question 3

Here is an almost complete Turing machine. It moves the first bit of input to the end of the input. Here are a few examples.

## Question 4

Trace the first three steps of the Turing machine in the previous question giving the following initial configuration by showing the successive configurations. List one configuration per line with a single space separating each part of the configuration. Recall that the parts of the configuration are in the following order: current-state current-head tape-to-left tape-to-right.

Use "e" for Îµ and use it only in the "tape-to-left" or "tape-to-right" positions when there is nothing but blanks in those directions. Otherwise list all characters explicitly (and use B for a blank character when needed).
