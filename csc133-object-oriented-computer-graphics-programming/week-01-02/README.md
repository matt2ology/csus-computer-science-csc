### Submission and Requirements

#### Code Requirements

1. You must limit your code to 80 characters (width) so that it is readable in
    Speed Grader. We will talk more about this as we go forward and it is good
    practice to improve the readability of your code. I will discuss this
    briefly in class.
2. Your code must be neat and properly aligned. Sloppy code will keep you out
    of the top spot.
3. For this assignment, you should describe what you are doing in comments for
    each method or function. We will talk about comments going forward.
4. You must include your entire program in a single Java file. There is no
    need for additional classes in this assignment. If you choose to use them,
    they must be non-public and included in your single Java file
5. Your java file submission must be entitled SimpleToolPaint.java

#### Submission

You will submit two files:

1. Your SimpleToolPaint.java
2. A file called SimpleToolPaintDemo.mp4 that is a video of you briefly
    demonstrating you compiling, running, and using your paint program.
    Demo as much as you can in a program that is strictly less than two
    minutes in length. Please narrate your video and tell us what you're doing.

I recommend the use of OBS to capture your screen. It has a built in method
to output mp4 files. I do not accept other file types nor linked videos.
I will discuss how to do this briefly in class.
