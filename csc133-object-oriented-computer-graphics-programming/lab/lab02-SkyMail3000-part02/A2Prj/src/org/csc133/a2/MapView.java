/**
 * <h1><code>MapView</code></h1>
 * <p>
 * Will also display the contents of the game graphically in the container in
 * the middle of the game screen (in addition to displaying it in the text form
 * on the console)
 * </p>
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * When the MapView update() is invoked, it should call repaint() on itself. As
 * described in the lecture, one way to implement this is to have MapView
 * override paint(), which will be invoked as a result of calling repaint(). It
 * is then the duty of paint() to iterate through the game objects invoking
 * draw() in each object â€“ thus redrawing all the objects in the world in the
 * container. Note that paint() must have access to the GameWorld. That means
 * that the reference to the GameWorld must be saved when MapView is
 * constructed,+ or alternatively the update() method must save it prior to
 * calling repaint(). Note that the modified MapView class communicates with the
 * rest of the program exactly as it did previously (e.g., it is an observer of
 * GameWorld).
