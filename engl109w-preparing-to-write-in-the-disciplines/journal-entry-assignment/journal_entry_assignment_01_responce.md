## Part 2: From the chart above, write the one identity that best fits each statement below. (Please write at least one paragraph for each question.)

### 1. The identity that you think of the most often. Why?

The identity that I think of the most often is academic discipline/major.  Although I love my major,
have an internship in industry, and find ways to apply my studies in everyday life I'm unsure if I'd like
to only code for the rest of my career.  Most of the engineers I work with, in addition to their
technical degrees have MBAs, and manage other teams/product lines.

Coding is great, to always learn as the industry advance and improve, but I feel that to better my
career is to go into management and marketing.

### 2. The identity that you think about the least. Why?

The identity that I think about the least is religion; for, I am more influenced by philosophy than faith.

### 3. The identity that has the strongest effect, positively or negatively, on how you perceive your writing skills/abilities. Why?

The identity that has the strongest effect, positively or negatively, on how I perceive my writing
skills/abilities is academic discipline/major.  Computer Science encourage and emphasize
critical logic, reasoning, and structured thinking; as a result, I find myself more compelled and
comfortable writing technical documents and non-fiction than I do with fiction writing.

### 4. The identity that has the greatest effect, positively or negatively, on how others recognize your writing skills/abilities. Why?

The identity that has the greatest positive effect on how others recognize my writing skills/abilities is
my academic discipline/major.  Computer Science students practice "Stepwise Refinement",
also known as "Divide-and-Conquer", a thinking process where one takes some arbitrary sized
problem and break down each component, recursively, to some trivial state or action; as a result,
I've been told that I am able to take any technical topic, abstract the core idea, and explain simply
who would care for such things, what it does, when would someone use it, where it can be applies,
how it can be used, and why does it matter.
