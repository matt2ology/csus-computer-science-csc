## Assignment

Use NLP, Natural Language Processing, to convert the text descriptions of each
nonprofit into the rows of one big document term matrix. The resulting matrix
will have one row for every 990 form that has a description, and one column for
every word in the lexicon. In the next assignment we will use this matrix to
cluster the nonprofits based on their descriptions.

### Your program should do the following

1. Extract the organization name, one or more text elements that describe the nonprofit, and another element that can be used as a proxy for size, such as revenue, number of employees, etc.
   1. Organization name `<BusinessName>`
   2. Nonprofit description

2. Process the text descriptions using a similar process as [described in class](Introduction%20Natural%20Language%20Processing%20-%20Clark%20Fitzgerald.pdf).
3. Create and save the term document matrix.

### Run your program, and report the following

1. How many of the returns were you able to process?
2. Show one explicit example of how you processed the text.
   What was the input and output?
3. What are the dimensions of your term document matrix?
4. How long did your program take to run? (It should be less than half an hour,
   but no problem if it takes longer, either.)
5. Which part of the program took the longest?
