## Assignment

Use NLP to convert[^1] the text descriptions of each nonprofit into the rows of one
big document term matrix. The resulting matrix will have one row for every 990
form that has a description, and one column for every word in the lexicon. In
the next assignment we will use this matrix to cluster the nonprofits based on
their descriptions.
