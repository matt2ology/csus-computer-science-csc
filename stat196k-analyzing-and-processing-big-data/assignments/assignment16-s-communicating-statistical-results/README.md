# S - Communicating Statistical Results

**Due** Apr 20 at 11:59pm | **Points** 5 | **Submitting** Graded Discussion

---

Find an example of a piece of writing or public speaking that communicates a statistical result.

- Copy the text (not more than 1 paragraph) and the link, if applicable.
- How effective is the communication? What makes it effective or ineffective? How could it be better?
- Comment briefly on at least two of your peers' posts.

If you're looking for material, then just look at anything involving politics and statistics.
Politicians are not statisticians.

## Example

From [Rene Herse Cycles - How We Test Tires](https://www.renehersecycles.com/how-we-test-tires/) by Jan Heine:

      Statistical analysis is a standard part of all scientific studies. It shows
      we’ve been successful in reducing the noise in our data. Basically, it
      calculates the likelihood that our results are not simply due to chance.
      For example, it’s doesn’t come as a surprise that the difference between
      the 44 mm and 28 mm tires above (0.04 seconds or 0.3%) is not statistically
      significant. (We checked just in case – it isn’t.)

I believe this writing is effective at explaining the statistical methodology for bicycle tire testing to a general audience, but I think it could be strengthened by focusing less on the statistical significance and more on the practical significance. It also contains some subtle errors in the role of statistics and interpretation. I would rewrite it as follows:

      Statistical analysis of repeated measurements provides a reliable way to
      detect practical differences in speed, which allows us to say confidently
      whether one tire is faster than another. For example, we can say with 95%
      confidence that the mean difference between the 44 mm and 28 mm tires
      above is between (-0.10, 0.12) seconds, which is neither practically
      significant nor statistically significant.

An earlier version of the post had more errors, but I emailed the author and he changed it.
