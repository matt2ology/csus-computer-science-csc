# Assignment 14 - Skill - verifying assumptions in data

**Due** Tuesday by 11:59pm | **Points** 5 | **Submitting** a text entry box

Verify the correspondence between `irs990extract`, `terms`, and `termfreq` described in the [clustering homework](./assignment15-h-clustering.md) by picking a random index from irs990extract and checking that the terms in termfreq are actually in the corresponding mission description.

Turn in code with output from the Julia REPL demonstrating this. Each student should have a different example.
