## Assignment

Come up with a question using college student data that can be answered using a
grouped computation. Suppose the data is in the format described by [ECMC](http://ecmc-z41d.damoursystems.com/data_sets/students.html).
Describe some context, how you would answer the question, and the potential
significance of the result. Suppose you have the data you need.

## Example

Are Hispanic students more or less likely than other students to take upper division statistics classes? To answer this question, I would need two columns for each student: the number of upper division statistics courses they've taken, and their ethnicity. I would then calculate MEAN(num_upper_stats) grouped by ethnicity. CSUS is designated as an HSI (Hispanic Serving Institution), and we have some grant money available to help promote equity within our classes, but first we need to determine where there are equity issues.
