# Exercise22: S - Grouped Computations

Is there a divide between first generation Asian American students who speaks
just English versus their other students who are also taught English as a second
language (in addition to Ethnic language)?  

To answer this, I would group `ethnicity` selecting for `Asian`, `first_generation`,
and `english_2nd_language`.  This could be scatter plotted on a graph where the X-axis
be a GPA range (from left to right) 0.0 to 4.5; and, along the Y-axis where 0 is
`FALSE` and 1 is `TRUE` be a marker if the student learned English as a second language.

The motive to see the results of this inquiry is to see if Asian parent's strategy
to only teach their first gen children only English in hopes that they'd do well
in American schools is actually beneficial as they'd thought it be or not.
