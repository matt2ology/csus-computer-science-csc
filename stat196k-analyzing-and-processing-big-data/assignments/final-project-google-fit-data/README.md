# Final Project

**Due** May 14 by 11:59pm | **Points** 100 | **Submitting** A website url or a file upload

---

Demonstrate something you've learned in this class through your final project. This project is intentionally open ended, so that you can pick something that aligns with your goals and interests.

## Audience

A goal of this project is to produce a creative result that you can show to other people. Start with a specific audience in mind, and think about what impression you want to give them.

For example, if you want to show this project to a software engineering recruiter from Google, then you need to demonstrate excellent programming ability. If you want to show it to an admissions committee for a graduate school in public health, then you should analyze data related to public health, and display some familiarity with the field.

## Requirements

1. Incorporate at least one of the following topics into your project:

   1. cloud computing (AWS EC2)
   2. databases (AWS Athena)
   3. large datasets (say greater than 500 MB- any of the data sets we used in this class 1. will work)
   4. complex datasets (XML, JSON)
   5. streaming computations (bash pipelines)
   6. Julia programming
   7. natural language processing (NLP)
   8. dimension reduction / clustering
   9. distributional tests (chi square and QQ plots)

2. Turn in a pdf project summary between 0.5 and 1 page summarizing the project at a high level.

3. Turn in the main project, which could be a data analysis report in PDF or HTML, a script or software you developed on Github, a refined data set that you generated in S3, or something else along these lines. Links to public URL's are fine.

4. You may extend a project you worked on outside of this class. If you do, then clearly state in your summary what you are counting towards this final project.

5. Do not turn in the same project for multiple classes, or copy a project that is not your own.

6. You may work solo, or in a team of up to 3 people. Teams should turn in more impressive projects.
