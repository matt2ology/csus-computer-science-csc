# S - Hypothetical Examples of Clusters - Response

**Due** Apr 8 | **Points** 5 points possible | **Submitting** discussion

---

Come up with an example of a hypothetical data set and explain why you might or
might not see any evidence of clustering. Have fun! It's OK if it's not possible
to collect the data.

- Write a short paragraph. Appropriate pictures are great too, if you feel motivated.
- Comment on two of your peers posts, starting with those who don't yet have any comments.

Suppose we have a data set of people who pronounce caramel as caramel and people
who prounounce GIF as GIF
