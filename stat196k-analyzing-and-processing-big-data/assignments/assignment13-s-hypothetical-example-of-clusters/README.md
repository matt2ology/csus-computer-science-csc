# S - Hypothetical Examples of Clusters

**Due** Apr 8 | **Points** 5 points possible | **Submitting** discussion

---

Come up with an example of a hypothetical data set and explain why you might or
might not see any evidence of clustering. Have fun! It's OK if it's not possible
to collect the data.

- Write a short paragraph. Appropriate pictures are great too, if you feel motivated.
- Comment on two of your peers posts, starting with those who don't yet have any comments.

## Example

[Male California sea lions](https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/california-sea-lion)
weigh around 600 pounds, and females weight around 220 pounds. Suppose that we
had a data set of physical measurements for a random sample of wild adult sea
lions, including body weight, body length, fin length, and whisker length. I
expect that if we clustered them into two groups based on these measurements,
then there would be two obvious clusters corresponding to the male and female
sea lions. Furthermore, I expect that body weight would be the most important
variable that determines the clustering, because males on average weigh 2.7
times more than females, and I doubt that the other measurements differ by that
much magnitude.
