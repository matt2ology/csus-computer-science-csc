## Assignment

Use NLP, Natural Language Processing, to convert the text descriptions of each
nonprofit into the rows of one big document term matrix. The resulting matrix
will have one row for every 990 form that has a description, and one column for
every word in the lexicon. In the next assignment we will use this matrix to
cluster the nonprofits based on their descriptions.

### Your program should do the following

1. Extract the organization name, one or more text elements that describe the
   nonprofit, and another element that can be used as a proxy for size, such as
   revenue, number of employees, etc.

   1. **Organization Name**
      1. Variable Name: `BsnssNm_BsnssNmLn1Txt`
         1. Variable Table: returnheader990x_part_i [ Schedule Part ]
         2. Line Number:
         3. Description: Business name line 1
         4. Type: String(length=75)
         5. **Xpath**: `//ReturnHeader/Filer/BusinessName/BusinessNameLine1Txt`
         6. Reference: <http://www.irsx.info/metadata/parts/returnheader990x_part_i.html>
      2. Variable Name: `DngBsnssAsNm_BsnssNmLn1Txt`

         5. **Xpath**: `//IRS990EZ/ProgramSrvcAccomplishmentGrp/DescriptionProgramSrvcAccomTxt`
         6. Reference: <http://www.irsx.info/metadata/groups/EZPrgrmSrvcAccmplshmnt.html>
   3. **Revenue** (proxy for size)

         4. Type: BigInteger
         5. **Xpath**: `//IRS990/RevenueAmt`

         4. Type: BigInteger
         5. **Xpath**: `//IRS990/TotalRevenueGrp/TotalRevenueColumnAmt`
         6. Reference: <http://www.irsx.info/metadata/parts/part_viii.html>
   4. **Number of Employees** (proxy for size)
      1. Variable Name: `EmplyCnt`
         1. Variable Table: part_v [ Schedule Part ]
         2. Line Number: Part V Line 2a
         3. Description: Number of employees
         4. Type: Integer
         5. **Xpath**: `//IRS990/EmployeeCnt`
         6. Reference: <http://www.irsx.info/metadata/parts/part_v.html>

   ```julia
   # Grab file
   xml_file = "sample-data/2019-sample/201900079349300005_public.xml"
   xpath = "//IRS990/MissionDesc"
   # Read the file into a document
   xml_document = readxml(xml_file)
   # Find first instance of Xpath with XML tags
   xml_node = findfirst("xpath",xml_document)
   # with `/text()` it removes XML tags
   # xpath_text = "//IRS990/MissionDesc/text()"
   # xml_node = findfirst("//IRS990/MissionDesc/text()",xml_document)
   """
   XML node is given rather than text contained in the node what is given is
   the XML node meaning that entire XML document continues to exist in memory,
   which will use up all the memory, even if you have an instance with 32 GB of memory.
   """
   xml_node_content = nodecontent(xml_node)
   ```

2. Process the text descriptions using a similar process as [described in class](Introduction%20Natural%20Language%20Processing%20-%20Clark%20Fitzgerald.pdf).

   ```julia
   @info "Processing description text"
   description = [entry["organization_description"] for entry in dictionary_of_xml_node_text]

   string_test = [StringDocument(" ")]
   collection_of_files_processed = collect(Int, size(IRS990_2019_FILES))
   for file in 1:collection_of_files_processed[1]
       push!(string_test, StringDocument(description[file]))
   end

   println("The total number of processed description text: ", collection_of_files_processed[1])
   ```

3. Create and save the term document matrix.

### Run your program, and report the following

1. How many of the returns were you able to process?
   > test
2. Show one explicit example of how you processed the text.
   What was the input and output?
   > test
3. What are the dimensions of your term document matrix?
   > test
4. How long did your program take to run? (It should be less than half an hour,
   but no problem if it takes longer, either.)
   > test
5. Which part of the program took the longest?
   > test

  - If you assign/return `findfirst("//Desc/text()", doc)` the XML node is given.
    So, rather than text contained in the node what is given is the XML node

    use up all the memory, even if you have an instance with 32 GB of memory.
    - The way to fix this is to return only
