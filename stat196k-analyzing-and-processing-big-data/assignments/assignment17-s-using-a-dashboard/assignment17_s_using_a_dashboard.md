# Exercise17: S - Using a dashboard

Although we had a "boom" in covid cases from late October/early November for it
to come down late January to mid-March...

I am curious to know if the rising trend towards late March is a spike in cases
of a younger demographic who ignored social distancing and celebrated Spring Break
in large crowds.
